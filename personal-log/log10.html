I didn’t *find* Vault E-7.

I *tripped into it*.

No beacon. No signal. Just a wrong turn down a canyon that shouldn't have existed on Cadriss’s old maps. One second I was mapping mineral veins, the next my ship sensors shorted out. Then came the static — sharp, constant, *whispery.* It guided me down a crack in the rocks, like gravity had ideas of its own.

And then: the door. A circle of rusted metal covered in symbols that hurt to look at. My ship couldn’t translate them — *not because they were foreign, but because they kept changing.* Even my own handwriting glitched when I tried sketching them.

Inside… everything was wrong. Angles bent the *wrong way.* Light sources had no source. My footsteps echoed *before* I made them.

And in the middle of that crooked, mind-numbing space — a chair.

Old, leather-strapped, facing a cracked mirror.

A mirror that didn’t show me.

It showed *versions* of me.

Dead. Broken. Happy. Screaming. Disintegrated. Not alone.

Something moved behind the mirror, just out of sync with time. I swear it was trying to speak, but the words looped and rewound like corrupted data.

I ran.

No shame. No hesitation. I *ran.*

Vault E-7 sealed behind me without a sound, as if it had never been open.

Now, every once in a while, I hear a faint knock in my ship. In rhythm. Like… a pattern. Like a request.

I haven’t slept in a straight line since.
