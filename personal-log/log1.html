They said Rhellan wasn’t made for people like me.

And they were right.

You don’t land on Rhellan — you *leak* into it. The moment I stepped off the ramp, it was like gravity didn’t trust itself. The surface twitched beneath my boots like skin with a memory. Nothing stays still here — not the soil, not the sky, not even your own thoughts if you stare too long into the violet mist.

The locals call it a "living planet," but no one really explained *what* it’s living for.

My visor picked up pulses underground, like the planet breathes. I passed towers made of fused bone and glass — some still whispering. Whole colonies once lived here, vanished overnight. I saw outlines of people burned into stone. No wreckage. Just… residue.

I tried sleeping once — the wind whispered in languages I didn’t know. When I woke up, my recorder was turned on.

I didn’t turn it on.

But I’m still here. I made it out. Not many can say that. Rhellan didn’t want me dead — just remembered.

That’s somehow worse.
