I thought I knew what “hot” meant.

Then I walked the Steppe.

It’s not the kind of heat that bakes you — it *peels* you. Scrapes layer after layer off your skin and memory, like the sun’s trying to see what you’re hiding. No real shade. Just husks of old war machines half-swallowed by sand. Some still twitch.

I followed a rust trail for eight clicks. Heard voices. Not mine. Not friendly. They came from the towers — black stone monoliths that hummed when I got close. My compass spun like it was panicking. Time felt… detached. My boots moved, but I couldn’t swear I was getting anywhere.

Ran into a scavenger caravan — one of those silent types who don’t bother with names or faces. Traded me a filter mask for half my rations. Fair deal. I think.

The sand here cuts deeper than knives. They say the Steppe remembers the war. Still burning from it. Still *fighting* it.

I left with cracked lips, scorched boots, and something whispering in my radio.

Haven’t turned it off since.

– Niemand
