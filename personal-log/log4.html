I don’t usually dock anywhere near Genezen space. Too quiet. Too sterile. Like guilt has a scent and it lingers in the air.

But I ran low on oxygen and patience, so I stopped at one of their orbital monasteries.

They welcomed me with open arms. Not smiles. Just… stillness. Like they'd already forgiven me for sins I hadn’t confessed yet.

She called herself Virel — skin like porcelain veined with gold, eyes deep enough to reflect your regrets. She didn’t ask why I was out here. She just said, “It’s heavy, isn’t it? Carrying silence between stars.”

We didn’t talk much. We shared tea that pulsed with biotech warmth, and she placed her hand on my temple. Not a scan — a comfort.

Then she said, “Even the unchosen have purpose. Sometimes the ones who wander hear the clearest echoes.”

I don’t believe in fate. But I left feeling like I’d brushed against something… *kind*. Something too old and too patient to care whether I understood it.

– Niemand
