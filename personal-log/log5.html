I didn’t plan to end up in a Shimoku Ball — nobody *plans* that. I was tailing a black market courier through the neon guts of Nex Vox when the trail led me right into the mouth of madness.

The entrance was a whisper behind a curtain of sound. Strobing lights. Impossible shapes. Beings that flickered between dimensions mid-dance. No tickets, no rules, just rhythm and risk.

I kept my hood up. Stayed close to the wall. The crowd moved like liquid chaos — everyone dancing, no one watching. Except the Eyes. Mechanical. Organic. Watching from the ceiling, the floor, inside drinks.

Some say Shimoku Balls are psychic nets — that if you lose yourself in the beat, the Ball keeps you. Mind hollowed. Body dancing forever.

I saw someone glitch mid-twirl, their face fracturing like glass. Security never came. The crowd just cheered louder.

I had to cross the dancefloor to reach the courier. Every step was a gamble. The floor pulsed with memory. I swear, I saw *myself* in the crowd — smiling, younger, happier. I didn’t stop to ask questions.

I got out. Barely. The courier didn’t. He’s probably still dancing.

I don’t sleep well lately. Sometimes I hear the music.
