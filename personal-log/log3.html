I didn’t mean to drift this close.

One course correction missed, and I was scraping the gravity well of Stellar Wound Theta — a rip in space that *bleeds light wrong*. It’s not a black hole. Not really. It pulses, like it’s remembering something painful.

No comms. No nav ping. My ship—barely stitched together to begin with—went dead silent. No sound but the soft clatter of a loose bolt. Even my breathing felt… delayed. Like I was hearing it from outside myself.

I saw something in the distortion. Not a ship. Not debris. A *shadow* walking along the hull from the *inside*. I didn’t scream. Didn’t move. Just stared.

And then it was gone.

Managed to jolt the FTL back with a hard burn from a salvaged core tap. Fried half the stabilizers, but I got out.

Barely.

The stars haven’t looked right since. They don’t… line up like they used to.

Sometimes I think I’m still drifting there.

Still in the Wound.
