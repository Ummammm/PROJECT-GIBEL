You’d think I’d have learned by now — don’t snoop near smuggler routes marked with golden filigree and drama masks. But curiosity has teeth, and mine bit hard.

I was mapping a derelict port near the Zephyros Verge. Empty. Quiet. Too quiet. Then the lights hit — literal stage lights. Spotlights from ceiling drones. Applause from hidden speakers. Theatrics cranked to eleven.

Next thing I know, I'm center stage in some mock trial, wrists bound with shimmering synth-ribbon. My "crime"? Trespassing on sacred ground. Their sacred ground.

The Golden Theatre doesn’t kill you, not right away. They *perform* you. They turn your story into a tragedy, comedy, or — if you’re lucky — experimental abstract art. I was cast as “The Wandering Fool.” Great.

They made me relive moments from my own logs. Twisted, rewritten, exaggerated. Jarrin Fell was there too — played by an actor with six arms and a dramatic stutter. It was almost... impressive.

I escaped thanks to a set malfunction — and a little help from a rogue spotlight AI who took a liking to my “raw emotional authenticity.” Go figure.

Still... part of me wonders if I *did* escape. Or if I’m still trapped in that play, and this log is just the next act.
