It wasn’t a temple. It wasn’t even a building. Just a worn-out tarp stretched between two shuttle wrecks, lit by bioluminescent moss and the weak glow of a dying sun.

That’s where I saw the Amanat. Pale, almost transparent, like her skin was made of morning fog. They called her Elurein. No armor. No grand robes. Just a threadbare shawl, and eyes that looked like they could see the shape of your pain.

A miner had been crushed by a cave-in. Ribs shattered. Blood where it shouldn’t be. The local medtechs had written him off. Said he’d be gone by nightfall.

But Elurein just sat with him. Pressed her hands over his chest. Closed her eyes.

No flashy lights. No holy chanting. Just… warmth.

I don’t know how long it took. Maybe an hour. Maybe ten minutes. But when she opened her eyes again, the man was breathing steady. Still broken, still bloodied — but alive.

The weird part? He didn’t thank her. No one did. They just nodded. Like this wasn’t a miracle, just something the universe had quietly allowed.

I tried to ask her how she did it.

She looked at me and said,  
> “We do not mend bodies. We remind them why they wanted to stay.”

And then she walked away.

I stayed under that tarp for a while after.

Not because I was hurt. Just… to remember.

– Niemand
