You haven’t really *met* a Rokatan until you’ve felt the heat of their forge on your skin, the silence between hammer strikes, and the way they speak through steel more than words.

I’d limped into the outer rim of Thrum’Vok Cradle, one of House Schmied’s minor ringworld enclaves — mostly Rokatan artisans and war-foundries. My ship needed patching. So did I.

I found a forge by following the sound of metal crying. There, a blacksmith named Borrek didn’t ask who I was, or why I looked like I'd just escaped an orbital ghost storm. He just pointed to the fire, then tossed me a pair of tongs.

We didn’t talk much. We *worked*. Hours, maybe days. Shaping a blade with no purpose. I think that was the point. The heat blurred time, and the rhythm of the anvil grounded me better than any medbay ever could.

Eventually, he took the blade and carved a single symbol into its edge — looked like a spiral sun. “Means you bent. Didn’t break,” he finally said.

He let me keep it. Didn’t ask for anything in return. Just nodded when I left, as if we'd both agreed on something neither of us said out loud.

I still have that blade. Haven’t used it. Probably never will.

But it reminds me I’m not the only one trying to shape something out of the ruins.

– Niemand
