I shouldn't have gone in alone.

Nael’Thura was supposed to be uninhabited — "bio-fractured," they said. Whatever that means. I landed in what looked like the husk of a once-beautiful grove. Trees still stood, but their bark had peeled away, revealing smooth, pinkish fibers beneath. Not wood. Not even plant. More like… dermal tissue.

Then the wind blew.

It didn't make a sound, not really. Just a rustle that reminded me of whispers on wet flesh. Every petal, every vine, every fallen leaf looked like something that once belonged *inside* a body. The deeper I walked, the more I saw. Eyes embedded in tree trunks. Smiling lips on flower buds. A pulsing root network that twitched when I stepped too close.

And then I found the statue.

Not made. Grown.

A humanoid figure, maybe Shivana in origin, preserved mid-scream, their skin stretched outwards — into the surrounding flora. Absorbed. A monument to a moment of terror. I backed away. I shouldn't have turned my back, but I did. I swear the garden *sighed.*

I made it back to the ship with a strip of vine wrapped around my boot. It took days before it stopped writhing.

Locals whisper that the garden was born from a failed experiment — biotech merged with trauma, turned loose after a civil war no one admits happened. Some say it's sentient. Lonely, even. Wants to *feel* again. Wants to *be felt.*

Me? I burned my boots.

And I still dream of the statue.
