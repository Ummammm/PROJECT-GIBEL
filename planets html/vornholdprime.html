> ----------------------------

[1] TERRAIN:
Fortress-grade basalt cliffs, ridgelines carved into defensive emplacements. Endless plains of crushed stone and impact-hardened training fields. Mountains repurposed into citadel bunkers and automated watch-towers. Entire landscapes sculpted for warfare, not aesthetics.

[2] WEATHER CONDITIONS:
Cold, dry climate year-round. Average temp: -12°C to 5°C. Wind-chill across elevated ridges. Seasonal hailstorms known as “Iron Rain” (shrapnel-like ice formations) occur during orbit shift cycles.

[3] FLORA & FAUNA:
Minimal natural flora; only bio-hardened moss and trench grass survive. Fauna includes:
- **Stralhounds**: Pack-beasts used for blood-tracking drills.
- **Ironmaws**: Semi-domesticated reptiles used in arena trials.
- Native wildlife is either extinct or weaponized.

[4] METALS & PRECIOUS ORES:
High-yield deposits of:
- **Ferrocore**: Reinforced alloy base used for armor production.
- **Obsidax**: Volcanic glass-metal hybrid for bladed weapons.
- Trace amounts of **Aetherium**, mined under martial lockdown.

[5] COMMON WEATHER PHENOMENA:
- **Iron Rain**: Spiked hail resembling shrapnel.
- **Skyrip Gales**: Horizontal windstorms strong enough to displace armored transports.
- **Aurora Pulse**: Rare, blue-hued skyburst from magnetic field clashes—used as ceremonial omen before high-ranking duels.
