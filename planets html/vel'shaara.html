> ACCESSING FACTION NODE: HOUSE ARCANEL  
> LOCATION: VEL'SHARA  
> STATUS: ARCHIVAL LOG ACTIVE  
> ----------------------------

[1] TERRAIN:  
Floating crystalline platforms interconnected by leyline bridges. Massive arcology towers rise from arcane-engineered landmasses that orbit a volatile, glowing star. The surface is fractured—more a network of stabilized land-islets than traditional continents. Below: energy-choked void rifts.

[2] WEATHER CONDITIONS:  
Intense solar flares filtered through Arcanel solar wards. Radiation storms are frequent but controlled. Climate is warm, dry, and ever-charged with static. At twilight, the sky glows violet-gold from the unstable star’s emissions.

[3] FLORA & FAUNA:  
- **Flora**: Bioluminescent vine-trees, prism reeds, and mana-fed crystal flora used in spell-conduction.  
- **Fauna**:  
  - **Phase Lynx**: Semi-teleporting feline guardians.  
  - **Sundrakes**: Miniature solar wyrms bonded to elite Arcanel magi.  
  - **Synapse Crows**: Data-harvesting avians with glowing sigil feathers.

[4] METALS & PRECIOUS ORES:  
- **Aetherite Shards**: Pure magic-conductive crystal, highly unstable outside Arcanel labs.  
- **Quantiron**: Used in technomagical constructs and powered armor.  
- **Stellux Dust**: Rare byproduct of rift exposure, used for long-range psychic amplifiers.

[5] COMMON WEATHER PHENOMENA:  
- **Solar Arcs**: Visible lashes of energy across the skyline, often harvested by tower spires.  
- **Leybursts**: Sudden mana explosions causing terrain shifts or spontaneous levitation.  
- **Null Rains**: Occasional rains of liquid static that temporarily short-circuit tech but supercharge spellcasting.
