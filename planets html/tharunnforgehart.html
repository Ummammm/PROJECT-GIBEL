>> ACCESSING FACTION NODE: HOUSE SCHMEID  
> LOCATION: THARUUN FORGEHEART  
> STATUS: ARCHIVAL LOG ONLINE  
> ----------------------------

[1] TERRAIN:  
Jagged basalt mountain ranges scarred by industrial strip-mines and magma canals. Towering foundry-cities are built vertically into volcanoes or carved into tectonic shelves. The world’s crust is constantly in flux, with rivers of lava threading through dense smog valleys.

[2] WEATHER CONDITIONS:  
Extreme heat. Day and night cycles are barely noticeable due to the planet’s thick atmosphere and ever-present volcanic glow. Acid storms are common, and ash-fall can last for weeks. Most inhabitants live in reinforced habitats or subterranean bunkers.

[3] FLORA & FAUNA:  
- **Flora**: Sparse. Pyro-moss and firebloom flowers grow near vents. Metal-absorbing fungi are farmed for rare alloys.  
- **Fauna**:  
  - **Molten Hounds**: Lava-dwelling reptilian predators used as forge guardians.  
  - **Slag Beetles**: Insects that consume waste ore and excrete refined metals.  
  - **Fume Serpents**: Ash-colored serpents that nest in exhaust vents, heat-resistant and often worshipped by lower caste smiths.

[4] METALS & PRECIOUS ORES:  
- **Ferronyx**: Ultra-durable alloy native to Tharuun’s deep core, central to Schmied weaponry.  
- **Voltherium**: Conductive mineral essential to plasma-based tools and mech plating.  
- **Brimlite**: Rare glowing mineral formed only during tectonic ruptures, used in reactor cores.

[5] COMMON WEATHER PHENOMENA:  
- **Ash Cyclones**: Spinning columns of superheated soot and debris—deadly and unpredictable.  
- **Forge Storms**: Electromagnetic eruptions caused by subterranean quakes, often followed by metal “rain.”  
- **Core Pulses**: Planet-wide tremors from molten core surges, briefly powering all industrial systems with surplus energy.
