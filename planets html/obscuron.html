> ----------------------------

[1] TERRAIN:  
Obscuron is a rogue planet—untethered from any star—drifting in the dark void between systems. Surface terrain is jagged, obsidian-black, and riddled with ancient ruins, collapsed monoliths, and echoing ravines. Cities are built underground or carved into dormant asteroid craters. Aboveground, only those trained to move silently survive.

[2] WEATHER CONDITIONS:  
No sun, no natural light. Obscuron is a world of near-constant cold, illuminated only by bioluminescence and artificial moons. Temperature is brutally low, with pockets of localized heat generated by hidden reactors or geothermal vents. Winds move unnaturally—silent, but deadly cold.

[3] FLORA & FAUNA:  
- **Flora**:  
  - **Ash Ferns**: Feed off radiation, grow in complete darkness. Used in stealth serum production.  
  - **Veinroot**: Glows faintly red, used for blood-coagulating agents. Grows only in high-pressure tunnels.  
  - **Wraith Ivy**: A creeping plant that dampens sound around it. Cultivated near sleeping quarters and meditation chambers.

- **Fauna**:  
  - **Silence Stalkers**: Catlike creatures that emit no sound and leave no thermal signature. Used as living scouts.  
  - **Gravemaws**: Massive, burrowing predators with sonic-sensitive echolocation. Only the best trainees hunt them as a rite of passage.  
  - **Ghost Scarabs**: Insectoids that cling to energy sources and can drain unshielded tech in minutes.

[4] METALS & PRECIOUS ORES:  
- **Nullsteel**: A resonance-dead metal, perfect for weaponry and armor meant to evade sensors.  
- **Echo Ore**: Vibrates at subsonic frequencies, used in assassination tech and neural scramblers.  
- **Obscurite Crystals**: Absorb psychic energy, used in Thrope assassin trials to dampen emotion and memory.

[5] COMMON WEATHER PHENOMENA:  
- **Whisper Blizzards**: Windless snowstorms that carry mental echoes—hallucinations of past targets or regrets.  
- **Static Drifts**: Areas of thick electromagnetic fog that scrambles AI and audio sensors.  
- **Darkfire Storms**: Rare bursts of black plasma lightning that travel across the sky like slow serpents, drawn to strong emotions or combat.
