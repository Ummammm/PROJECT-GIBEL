> ----------------------------

[1] TERRAIN:  
Vanthellis is a hyper-terraformed jungle paradise sculpted for indulgence and excess. Towering **crystal canopies** cover deep valleys of exotic vegetation, while **bio-sculpted mansions** and skywalk villas dot the treetops like luxury spores. The land was altered to perfection—no jagged cliffs, no untamed wilds, just curated opulence stretching from orchid-lined waterfalls to predator pens disguised as "gardens." Hidden courtyards open into **crystal opera domes**, and the terrain constantly reshapes to please its residents.

[2] WEATHER CONDITIONS:  
Artificial and always optimized. Mornings bring golden mist, afternoons warm breezes, and nights glittering starlight projected through orbiting weather satellites. Weather events are sometimes choreographed to fit parties, galas, or hunts. A sudden romantic thunderstorm? A starlit eclipse dinner? Vanthellis delivers.

[3] FLORA & FAUNA:  
- **Flora**:  
  - **Velvethorns**: Vines that bloom only to music, often used in orchestrated landscaping.  
  - **Sunglow Orchids**: Radiate soft warmth, often infused into cocktails or perfumes.  
  - **Bleedroot Trees**: Decorative and mildly carnivorous—used in elite garden mazes as deterrents.

- **Fauna**:  
  - **Chimeral Cats**: Genetically spliced predator-luxury pets. Lethal, loyal, and often dressed in jewelry.  
  - **Glass Serpents**: Transparent jungle snakes bred to patrol estate grounds and shimmer like fine art.  
  - **Opal Vultures**: Scavengers that consume waste and leave behind glittering bone-sand.

[4] METALS & PRECIOUS ORES:  
- **Luxurium**: A reflective, soft metal used in vanity tech and exclusive armor mods. Only mined beneath Vanthellis.  
- **Marbleglass**: Crystal-mineral hybrid used for estate walls, weapon hilts, and decorative blades.  
- **Fey-Aether Dust**: Psychedelic mineral often laced into stimulants or perfumes. Traded in silent auctions only.

[5] COMMON WEATHER PHENOMENA:  
- **Perfume Rains**: Scented mists released as part of ritual festivals or assassinations.  
- **Diamond Fog**: Refracted light fog that renders everything glittering. Harmless, but deeply distracting.  
- **Pulse Storms**: Rare, beautiful electric storms engineered for visual pleasure—sometimes used as power surges for hidden tech.
