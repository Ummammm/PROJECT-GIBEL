> ACCESSING PLANETARY ARCHIVE...  
> NODE: VHARN IX  
> DESIGNATION: CLASS-C FRONTIER COLONY // ABANDONED HABITATION ZONE  

------------------------------------------------------------  
[1] TERRAIN:  
>> Windswept savannahs and deep-cut river canyons span the northern hemisphere.  
>> Southern hemisphere largely mountainous, riddled with ancient bunkers from the First Expansion Era.  
>> Surface scattered with crumbling biodomes and ruined terraforming pylons.  

[2] WEATHER CONDITIONS:  
>> Temperate-to-arid across most latitudes.  
>> High-wind dust seasons known as “Red Months” obscure vision for weeks.  
>> Thin atmosphere—partial breathability without aid in lowlands only.  

[3] FLORA & FAUNA:  
>> Flora: Spinebrush, Glassreed, Thornbulbs—resilient and drought-tolerant.  
>> Fauna: Skyrenders (avian hunters with bladed tails), Barkhorns (herbivorous tank-beasts), Vermen (adaptive mammal-scavengers).  
>> Many species have mutated due to failed terraforming.  

[4] METALS / PRECIOUS ORES:  
>> Common: Ferroslate, Tellurium, Gaseous Xenite (used in ship shielding).  
>> Rare: Dust Opals—used in cloaking tech, now mined only by black market syndicates.  
>> Deep-core layers believed to contain relic caches from Oldsmen expeditionary fleets.  

[5] COMMON WEATHER PHENOMENA:  
>> Red Dust Cyclones — massive electrostatic storms during the Red Months.  
>> Gravity Flux Zones — unstable fields near failed terraformer cores; cause tech to behave unpredictably.  
>> Dry Lightning Clusters — frequent in canyon zones, often frying unshielded drones.  

------------------------------------------------------------  
> STATUS: OFFICIALLY ABANDONED — UNOFFICIAL SETTLER PRESENCE CONFIRMED  
> CURRENT OCCUPANTS: SCAVENGERS, OUTLAWS, BLACKSITE RESEARCH TEAMS  
> ARCHIVE FLAG: POTENTIAL OLD MEN CACHE UNDER GLASS MESA [LOCKED]
