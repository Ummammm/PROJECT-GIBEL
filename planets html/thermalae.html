> ACCESSING PLANETARY ARCHIVE...  
> NODE: THERMALAE  
> CLASSIFICATION: CORE-WORLD // VOLCANIC TRADE HUB  
> ARCHIVAL INTEGRITY: STABLE // OPEN ACCESS GRANTED  
------------------------------------------------------------

[1] TERRAIN:  
>> A hyper-volcanic world veined with rivers of magma and jagged obsidian fields.  
>> Cities are carved into ancient lava tubes or suspended along sheer caldera cliffs.  
>> Surface terrain constantly shifts due to deep tectonic unrest.

[2] WEATHER CONDITIONS:  
>> Extremely hot and arid; ambient temperatures often exceed 70°C in exposed regions.  
>> Frequent sulfuric windstorms and intense ashfall cloud the skies.  
>> Nights offer little relief—thermal radiation lingers in the atmosphere.

[3] FLORA & FAUNA:  
>> Flora: Ember thorns, magma orchids, and geothermal mosses cling to vents and cracks.  
>> Fauna: Lava serpents, ash mantises, and flame-backed caracals.  
>> Domesticated creatures like **Furnace Hounds** are used for tracking and perimeter defense.  

[4] METALS / PRECIOUS ORES:  
>> Rich in Scorchium (heat-resistant alloy), Magmite (plasma-grade energy conductor), and Obscenite (dense forge-metal).  
>> Rare finds include Pyrocrystals—volatile gems storing raw thermal energy.  
>> Rumors of ancient “Infernum Cores” deep in the mantle persist among rogue miners.

[5] COMMON WEATHER PHENOMENA:  
>> Emberquakes – seismic events that rupture lava plains and reawaken dormant vents.  
>> Flame Spirals – towering firestorms caused by atmospheric ignition loops.  
>> Smog Seasons – months-long periods where visibility drops to zero and breathing is hazardous without filters.

------------------------------------------------------------  
> PRIMARY CONTROL: HOUSE SCHMIED // TIER-3 INDUSTRIAL DOMINION  
> ECONOMIC ROLE: GALACTIC WEAPON FORGING, HEAT-BASED MANUFACTURING  
> CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE: PILGRIMAGE WORLD FOR THE FORGE-FOLLOWERS  
> SECURITY FLAG: MEDIUM – MINER DISPUTES / RELIC RAIDERS DETECTED
