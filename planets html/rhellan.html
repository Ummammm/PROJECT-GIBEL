> ACCESSING PLANETARY ARCHIVE...  
> NODE: RHELLAN  
> DESIGNATION: CLASS-A CORE-WORLD // FORMER HOUSE GENEZEN MEDICAL CITADEL  

------------------------------------------------------------  
[1] TERRAIN:  
>> Lush and fertile, defined by rolling hills, crystalline lakes, and sprawling bio-integrated architecture.  
>> Underground catacombs span the entire equator, originally used for stasis crypts and viral vaults.  
>> The "White Forest"—a dense grove of ivory-leafed trees—spreads across the north pole, considered sacred.

[2] WEATHER CONDITIONS:  
>> Mild and stable; engineered by House Genezen's climate cores.  
>> Occasional warm mists known to carry trace healing spores.  
>> Rare bio-tempest events caused by malfunctioning terra-biome stabilizers.

[3] FLORA & FAUNA:  
>> Flora: Bioluminescent mosses, Emberbloom trees, Sapgrass (used in medical serums).  
>> Fauna: Seraphores (gliding herbivores), Meduskin (photosynthetic skin-beasts once used in therapy), and Ghost Elk.  
>> Some fauna rumored to be bio-synthetic hybrids left from Genezen experiments.

[4] METALS / PRECIOUS ORES:  
>> Common: Silicryte, Bioquartz.  
>> Rare: Vitae Crystals — used to stabilize organic cybernetic links and Omni spinal threads.  
>> Vaults deep underground contain blacklisted bio-samples and forbidden gene stock.

[5] COMMON WEATHER PHENOMENA:  
>> Mending Rain — soft, golden-hued rain with minor regenerative properties (mostly neutralized now).  
>> Fog of Whispers — localized psychic fog that causes emotional hallucinations; tied to old psychic trauma networks.  
>> Static Bloom — brief surges of energy blooming across plantlife, typically before magnetic stormfronts.

------------------------------------------------------------  
> STATUS: LOCKED TO OUTSIDERS — SANCTIONED BY GENEZEN HIGH CLERICATE  
> CURRENT OCCUPANTS: HEALING CULTS, ROGUE BIOENGINEERS, PILGRIM FACTIONS  
> ARCHIVE FLAG: GIBEL DEVICE INTERACTION SUSPECTED [OMNI-LOCKED]
