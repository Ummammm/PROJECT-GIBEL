> ACCESSING PLANETARY ARCHIVE...  
> NODE: ZHO-TORR PRIME  
> DESIGNATION: CLASS-B INDUSTRIAL WORLD // FORMER HOUSE SCHMIED FORGING REALM

------------------------------------------------------------  
[1] TERRAIN:  
>> Mountainous and jagged, riddled with deep mining trenches and artificial plateaus.  
>> Cracked plains of obsidian-like stone, sculpted by constant tectonic churn.  
>> Mega-forges embedded directly into canyon walls—visible from orbit due to heat plumes.

[2] WEATHER CONDITIONS:  
>> Harsh and unstable; sky often choked by ash and metallic particulate.  
>> Acid rain storms frequent, especially near decommissioned fusion smelters.  
>> Lightning discharges common due to magnetic anomalies in the upper atmosphere.

[3] FLORA & FAUNA:  
>> Flora: Sparse and adapted to radiation—blister-shrubs, ironroot, plasma fungi (luminescent spores).  
>> Fauna: Scorch-wasps, burrowing flamehogs, and thermal drakes—reptilian creatures living near active magma vents.  
>> Deepforge Leviathans—rumored to exist in planetary core shafts. Rarely surface.

[4] METALS / PRECIOUS ORES:  
>> Common: Ferrulium, Vulcanite, Scrapite (usable waste alloy).  
>> Rare: Coreite — hyper-dense alloy used in spaceframe skeletons and Void Gate anchor tech.  
>> Old tunnels still hide proto-metals created in failed experiments—some unstable, others priceless.

[5] COMMON WEATHER PHENOMENA:  
>> Black Thunder — magnetic lightning storms without rain; can fry exposed tech.  
>> Forge Winds — dry, superheated gales that sweep across mining zones.  
>> Emberfall — ash-and-slag precipitation after mass forge events; smothers surface and causes short-term blinding.

------------------------------------------------------------  
> STATUS: PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL — OCCUPIED BY FORGE-GUILDS, SCRAPPER CLANS  
> CURRENT OCCUPANTS: RENEGADE SCHMIED CRAFTERS, TITANIUM TRIBUNAL SURVEYORS, INDEPENDENT MINING HOUSES  
> ARCHIVE FLAG: HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF OLD ASHCODE TECHNOLOGY [MONITORING ACTIVE]
