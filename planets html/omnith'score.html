> ACCESSING PLANETARY ARCHIVE...  
> NODE: OMNITH’S CORE  
> CLASSIFICATION: RED-ZONE WORLD // ANOMALOUS PLANETARY ENTITY  
> ARCHIVAL INTEGRITY: CLASSIFIED DEEPLOCK // LEVEL OMEGA-NULL  
------------------------------------------------------------

[1] TERRAIN:  
>> The planet is not terrain—it’s **architecture**.  
>> Shifting monoliths and black spires rise in perfect, unnatural geometries.  
>> Interior catacombs twist gravity; entire cities embedded upside-down within the crust.  
>> “The Core” itself is a burning singularity locked in a glass-black crucible—thought to be a **Gibel Device stabilizer** or possibly a living consciousness.

[2] WEATHER CONDITIONS:  
>> Weather is artificial and follows no scientific logic.  
>> Zones of absolute silence and lightlessness ("Null Pockets").  
>> Occasional bleeding skies—crimson auroras that ripple inwards, not outwards.  
>> Atmospheric pressure changes per observer perception.

[3] FLORA & FAUNA:  
>> Flora: Biomechanical trees with singing cores, neural ivy that links memories between individuals.  
>> Fauna: Only one confirmed species: the **Corewraith**—a creature made of energy and shadow, thought to guard or perhaps *become* the planet.  
>> Other presences are speculated but cannot be recorded—video and scans return corrupted or recursive loops.

[4] METALS / PRECIOUS ORES:  
>> Quantum-gold veins, refractive obsidian, and Ecliptite—a paradoxical mineral that contains more space than it occupies.  
>> The “Heartsteel” alloy extracted near the core is used in crafting Gibel Devices.  
>> Ancient Oldsmen scripts speak of **Keystone Ore**, rumored to manipulate time-space perception itself.

[5] COMMON WEATHER PHENOMENA:  
>> Reality Flickers – where geometry folds for moments and then snaps back.  
>> Anti-Rain – droplets that rise from the surface toward the sky, rewriting local gravity.  
>> Pulse Storms – bursts of sound and emotion detectable even by AI.

------------------------------------------------------------  
> PRIMARY CONTROL: NO KNOWN OWNER  
> ECONOMIC ROLE: FORBIDDEN // All expeditions require Omega Clearance  
> CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE: Believed to be the *original landing site* of the Oldsmen.  
> SECURITY FLAG: ABSOLUTE RED – ZERO SURVIVAL RATE BEYOND 7 DAYS

> STATUS: EXCLUDED FROM GALACTIC STAR CHARTS // SYMBOLICALLY “THE END OF ALL MAPS”
