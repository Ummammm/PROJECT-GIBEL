> ----------------------------

[1] TERRAIN:  
A chaotic, illusion-warped planet cloaked in dark nebula dust. The surface constantly shifts: desert becomes swamp, mountains flatten overnight, and cities rearrange their geometry. Only those attuned to its AI-pulse can navigate it. Hidden vaults and observatories cling to the landscape like mirages.

[2] WEATHER CONDITIONS:  
Unstable by design. The planet’s own terra-AI alters weather patterns in response to intrusions. A day may begin in arid heat and shift to magnetic snow or gravity inversions by dusk. No two weather cycles are the same.

[3] FLORA & FAUNA:  
- **Flora**:  
  - **Paradox Vines**: Plants that grow *backward*—leaves unfurl into buds, roots reach toward the sky. Used in energy-harvesting tech.  
  - **Mistcap Fungi**: Produce hallucinations and memory bleed when inhaled. Often harvested for psychic training.  
  - **Mirrorbark Trees**: Silvery bark reflects not the physical world but alternate timelines.

- **Fauna**:  
  - **Shadow Drifters**: Semi-ethereal fox-like creatures that phase in and out of reality. Believed to guide or mislead travelers.  
  - **Glim Hounds**: Pack predators that attack through mirrored dimensions.  
  - **Vaultbeetles**: Insect species that only emerge when a hidden cache is near.

[4] METALS & PRECIOUS ORES:  
- **Phasegold**: A mutable alloy that shifts form depending on dimensional frequency. Crucial for Gatefinder tools.  
- **Eclipsium**: Rare crystal that absorbs light, used in cloaking tech and stealth modules.  
- **Tesserite**: Hyperdense mineral used in portable wormhole stabilizers.

[5] COMMON WEATHER PHENOMENA:  
- **Fog of Echoes**: A thick mist that causes brief auditory hallucinations—often distant voices or alternate versions of oneself.  
- **Reality Shears**: Sudden bursts of dimensional overlap that fracture local space temporarily.  
- **Aurora Drift**: Luminous veils of energy that dance through the sky, altering gravity and thought patterns for hours.
