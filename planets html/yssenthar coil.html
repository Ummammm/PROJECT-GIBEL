> ACCESSING PLANETARY ARCHIVE...

------------------------------------------------------------

[1] TERRAIN:  
>> Fragmented planetary husk entangled in gravitational ribbons.  
>> Cracked crust forms shifting plate-bridges and spiraling trenches.  
>> Entire regions float midair, caught in time loops or slow-motion collapse.

[2] WEATHER CONDITIONS:  
>> Spatial instability causes micro-singularities and sudden void gusts.  
>> "Temporal Lightning"—bolts that strike both past and future coordinates.  
>> Temperature wildly fluctuates without warning; some regions freeze and burn simultaneously.

[3] FLORA & FAUNA:  
>> Flora: Crystalized spore-trees that hum at different timelines, “memory vines” that wrap around machinery and absorb its data.  
>> Fauna: Fractal foxes, phase-rats, and void-wasps.  
>> Rumors speak of **Grave Angels**, ghostlike entities made of shattered time echoes—possibly ex-sentinels or defense AIs gone rogue.

[4] METALS / PRECIOUS ORES:  
>> Chronostone (used in experimental warp tech), Flux-Iron (unstable unless shielded), and Relictite (sought by archivists, origin unknown).  
>> Detected fragments of Pre-Ascent tech buried deep in temporal folds.

[5] COMMON WEATHER PHENOMENA:  
>> Time Rips – zones where minutes loop endlessly or reverse in bursts.  
>> Gravity Cascades – sudden implosions that reverse themselves seconds later.  
>> Echo Storms – bursts of distorted light and sound, sometimes replaying past battles, screams, or unknown signals.

------------------------------------------------------------  
> PRIMARY CONTROL: NONE // DEEMED “UNCLAIMABLE”  
> ECONOMIC ROLE: EXTREME-RISK SALVAGING, BLACKSITE RESEARCH  
> CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE: AVOIDED BY MOST; WORSHIPED BY TIME-SPLIT CULTS  
> SECURITY FLAG: CRITICAL – KNOWN LOSS OF ENTIRE CREWS IN MINUTES
