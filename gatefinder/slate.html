[>] NAME : Kael Rho
[>] ALIAS : Slate
[>] ORIGIN : Ex-Wayferrer tactician. Became an independent strategist after a fallout with Guild Command.

[>] SPECIES : Human

[>] PAST LIFE : Ex-Wayferrer Guild, Kael was the youngest member to ever crack a three-layer Galactic encryption—blindfolded. He left the guild on his own terms after selling fake coordinates of a fake Gibel Gate to a corrupt House Arcanel heir, which exploded into a whole planetary scandal.

[>] PERSONALITY : Cool, sarcastic, wears headphones during gunfights. Never breaks a sweat, even when hacking a Gate while falling from a spaceship. He’s the "yeah bro, I planned for this" guy.

[>] GIBEL DEVICE : Veil of Echoes – allows perception of alternate outcomes and futures, like layered timelines.

[>] POWERS : Omni-Tech Interface: Can instinctively interface with Oldsmen tech and read code in seconds. Neural Pulse Grid: A tactical map in his mind, predicting short-term outcomes. EMP Touch: Can disable tech with his bare hands—great for traps, doors, and egos.

[>] MOTIVE : He's seen a version of the future where the Gibel Devices destroy everything. He's trying to stop it.

[>] RELATIONSHIP : Has a codependency with Nox—he grounds their chaos, they anchor his fractured perception. Teases Jarrin constantly but trusts him with his life. Secretly sees Lyra’s dark path and fears she might fall.


[>] GIBEL DEVICE AFFECTED : Veil of Echoes
Allows Slate to access fractured echoes of time — glimpses of possible futures, alternate outcomes, and probability threads. These are often disorienting but invaluable in critical decisions.

[>] CURRENT ROLE :
- Squad Strategist and Tactical Forecaster
- Navigates unknown terrain and mission permutations
- Handles comms blackout scenarios and fallback protocols

[>] PERSONAL NOTE :
“If it feels like luck, it was probably the plan.”
