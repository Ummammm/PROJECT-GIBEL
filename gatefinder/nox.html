[>] NAME : Unknown
[>] ALIAS : Nox
[>] ORIGIN : Former Band of Thrope operative. Erased from their ledgers. Presumed dead — until now.

[>] SPECIES : Unknown (possibly human-Ampho hybrid?)

[>] PAST LIFE : Nobody knows their real name—not even them. Former Band of Thrope assassin, Nox was conditioned from birth to kill. One day, during a Gate mission, they touched something... ancient. It broke the conditioning, erased their memories, and started a long journey toward rediscovery.

[>] PERSONALITY : Quiet, introspective, but surprisingly goofy when comfortable. They don’t talk much, but when they do—it’s either deep as hell or totally unhinged.

[>] GIBEL DEVICE : Null Crown – grants invisibility to all forms of memory and surveillance

[>] POWERS : Gate Echo: Fragments of Gate energy stuck in them allow brief reality-bending—short-rangae teleport, hallucination projection, time glitching. Shadow Style: Blade skills so smooth they look choreographed. Mimic Reflex: Can mirror another person’s fighting style after clashing blades.

[>] MOTIVE : Trying to find proof they exist. The Null Crown granted freedom—but at the cost of presence.

[>] RELATIONSHIP : Slate remembers them with effort and keeps coded mnemonics to anchor them. Jarrin recognizes their “animal scent,” which helps Lyra feels them like a phantom twin. They share a mutual loneliness.

[>] CURRENT ROLE :
- Stealth elimination and infiltration
- Gate recon missions that require zero trace
- Handles cleanup and threat neutralization

[>] PERSONAL NOTE :
"Death is quiet. So am I."
