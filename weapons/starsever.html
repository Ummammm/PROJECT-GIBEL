[>] DESIGNATION: STARSEVER
[>] TYPE: Melee-Class | Relic-Grade Energy Blade
[>] ORIGIN: Believed to be forged in the aftermath of the 2nd Gibel Conflict by a Rokatan Forge-Lord using the blood-coded remains of a fallen Omnis.

[>] DESCRIPTION:
A blade that pulses with deep violet light, STARSEVER is no ordinary weapon. Each swing leaves a spectral trail — as if slashing across timelines. It resonates in the presence of Gibel Devices and reacts violently to temporal anomalies.

[>] UNIQUE TRAITS:
— Can phase through non-organic matter briefly.
— Stores and releases kinetic charge via combat rhythm.
— Emits sub-sonic screams recorded from forgotten battles.

[>] USERS:
Carried exclusively by high-clearance Gate Finders or Blacksite Assassins. Rumored to have "chosen" its last three wielders.

[>] WARNING:
Do not attempt to replicate STARSEVER. All replication trials have resulted in spontaneous neural combustion or memory collapse.

[>] STATUS: Active. Currently bonded to JARRIN FELL.
