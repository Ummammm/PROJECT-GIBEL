> WEAPON CLASSIFICATION: ECHOCOIL RIFLE
> ORIGIN: HOUSE ARCANEL (FORGE SECTOR: TYLL'NAH CORE)

> DESCRIPTION:
The Echocoil Rifle is a semi-organic sniper weapon, fusing Shivana psionics with magnetic induction coils. 
It fires hyper-accelerated energy projectiles wrapped in a ripple-field—distorting space around the bullet 
just enough to bypass most armor without kinetic damage. 

> FIRING MODE: Precision Shock Pulse
> RANGE: Long-distance | Enhanced via Thought-Link
> CHARGE TIME: 2.4s (psionic stabilization delay)

> SPECIAL TRAIT:
The user’s neural imprint affects bullet behavior—veteran Shivana snipers can make a shot curve mid-air or 
phase through thin barriers. When wielded by an Arcanel Highmind, the rifle hums like a whispering choir, 
each shot guided by thought.

> LIMITATIONS:
Struggles in close quarters. Vulnerable to EMP disruption or psychic interference. Prolonged use can cause 
neural feedback loops in non-Shivana users.

> KNOWN USERS:
- [LYRA VEISS] — Arcanel Outlaw, current wielder.
- [SERAPHI QUIL] — Exiled Shivana Marksman.
