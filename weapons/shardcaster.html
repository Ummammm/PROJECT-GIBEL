`> WEAPON CLASS: SPLINTER-CATALYTIC RIFLE
> DESIGNATION: "SHARDCASTER"
> ORIGIN: HOUSE ARCANEL BLACKVAULTS — UNLICENSED

DESCRIPTION:
The Shardcaster weaponizes crystalline matter suspended in psionic flux. Each shot fires a burst of razor-edged shard projectiles encoded with kinetic memory, capable of seeking weak points in both armor and force-fields.

> TECH CORE:
Utilizes a rune-scribed channel chamber lined with rare Shivana mirrorstone. Shots fragment mid-air, creating directional scatter patterns that can be mentally guided by trained wielders.

> WARNING:
Non-Arcanel users report intense migraines, eye bleeding, and hallucinations involving fractal geometry. Not compatible with HUD systems.

FIELD QUOTES:
- "Felt like I was painting death across the battlefield—one prism at a time." — Shivana Adept-Scout, Echelon 3.
- "It sings when you pull the trigger. Not a song you'll forget." — Ex-smuggler turned Genezen test subject.

[ STATUS: RESTRICTED. SEEN IN USE BY SUBJECT: LYRA VEISS. ]
