DESCRIPTION:
An enigmatic weapon designed to tear open micro-rifts in localized space-time. Each discharge expels a concentrated gravitic anomaly—commonly referred to as a "void bloom"—capable of warping mass, distorting perception, or outright erasing small-scale matter.

> USAGE NOTES:
Voidcaster requires neural-link calibration. Firing may induce auditory hallucinations, limb tremors, or temporary quantum dislocation of memory.

FIELD QUOTES:
- "I shot once. The battlefield went silent. The stars were... wrong." — Anonymous Testimonial, Sector 19-C.
- "This gun whispers. You shouldn't listen." — Former Arcanel Engineer.

WARNING:
DO NOT store near reactive AI cores. Weapon reacts unpredictably to non-linear cognition. Handle with void-gloves only.

[ STATUS: ONE PROTOTYPE CONFIRMED. CURRENTLY IN POSSESSION OF AGENT: NOX. ]
