[ARCHIVE PROTOCOL INITIATED]

>> Entry Authored by: Niemand  
>> Log Classification: [Personal — Unverified Perspective]

I never meant to keep a record.

But the galaxy does things to you. It folds you in strange directions. I started writing so I wouldn’t forget where I’d been… or what I barely survived.

These archives aren’t official. No government seal. No House endorsement. No polished datastreams. Just notes—scattered, glitchy, honest. What I saw. What I felt. What I *think* might have happened.

Sometimes, it’s logs from the Pale Fold’s onboard recorder. Other times, it’s from places I don’t remember typing.

The entries cover planets, people, machines, corpses, relics. Some things that don’t even *have* names. If you’re reading this, treat everything like a suggestion. Not gospel.

I don’t lie. But memory does strange things when you stare into too many stars for too long.

> This archive exists for wanderers, scavengers, scholars, or the plain curious.  
> Not everything here will make sense. Some of it might hurt to read.  
> That’s how you know it’s real.
