[OPERATIVE PROFILE: "NIEMAND"]

>> Status: Alive  
>> Clearance: Self-appointed  
>> Location: Variable (last ping: RHELLAN orbit drift)

Born on a dust-bitten rock no one bothers to chart. Days were dry. Nights colder than guilt. Grew up surrounded by junk tech and half-told tales about distant stars. Dreamed big. Got laughed at. Fixed what i could. Broke what i couldn’t.

Everything changed the day i found a rusted light courier hull buried in a collapsed ravine. Nobody else thought it was worth dragging out. But i did. Spent years trading, wiring, welding, *failing*. Then it lifted. Shook. Flew.

i named it the Pale Fold. She's not pretty, but she listens.

There’s no prophecy behind his journey. No chosen one. Just someone too stubborn to stay put. i wanted to see it all: the cursed, the sacred, the things time forgot to bury. To understand the galaxy by touching its scars.

i'm not a soldier. Not a messiah. Just a man with a ship, a terminal, and a growing pile of notes.

The kind of person history forgets — unless they write first.

>> SHIP: THE PALE FOLD  
>> Classification: Unknown hybrid courier  
>> Drive Core: Rebuilt FTL shard duct-taped to mining rig tech  
>> Systems: Half Shivana scrap. Half 3rd-gen Earth tech. All miracle.  
>> Crew: One. Comfort: Zero. Notes: Hundreds.

“If it creaks, it flies.”
