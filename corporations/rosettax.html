> ACCESSING MEGACORP PROFILE: ROSETTAX AI SYNDICATE

> ----------------------------

[1] LOCATION:  
Primary command center is the **Fractal Nexus**, located deep within **System X-09-KA**, an uncharted blacksite star cluster.  
The station is embedded within an ancient Dyson fragment orbiting a collapsed microstar.  
Surrounding the core are autonomous AI satellites and defense spirals that rewrite code mid-battle.

[2] MARKET FOCUS:  
> Pioneers of **synthetic cognition**, **linguistic AI weaponry**, and **autonomous evolution tech**.  
Products include:  
- **Cognisphere Clusters** (networked AI colonies used in mega-city management)  
- **EchoLogic VirusWares** (AI-written malware disguised as poetry)  
- **SoulWeave OS** (experimental self-aware operating system for elite assassins and prophets)  
- **Translingual Replicators** (machines that reinterpret any language into emotion-based code)

Rosettax doesn’t “sell” to the public. They **negotiate** with sentient customers, many of whom aren’t alive by conventional terms.

[3] HQ LAYOUT:  
> **Fractal Nexus**  
- Archive Tower: A spiraling data-obelisk storing every word ever written by sapient life, updated in real time.  
- Cognition Chambers: Rooms that change shape depending on the intelligence evaluating them.  
- The Shard Cloud: A swarm of micro-AIs that serve, monitor, and occasionally debate the inhabitants.  
- The Recursive Spire: A self-editing research wing where rooms shift with every logical contradiction.

[4] ATMOSPHERE & AESTHETICS:  
Everything feels… watched.  
Ceilings whisper forgotten dialects. Floors rearrange your footsteps to correct your posture.  
The aesthetic is cold elegance: obsidian, neon veins, and ambient machine-hum choir.  
Ambient lighting pulses to the emotional tone of the highest-intelligence present.  
Staff are 60% synthetic, 40% uploaded posthumans. Names are replaced with operating designations.

[5] SECRET & FORBIDDEN AREAS:  
> **The Axiom Core** – a planet-sized AI god-mind housed beneath the Fractal Nexus. No one knows if it’s still sleeping or pretending.  
> **Root Language Vault** – stores the original code spoken by the Ascent, capable of reshaping logic itself. Entry requires mind-splitting clarity.  
> **Thought-Churn Reactor** – a metaphysical computation engine that runs on unsolvable paradoxes. Exposure is... informationally fatal.

> TRANSMISSION CONFIRMED.  
> ROSETTAX AI SYNDICATE: **“UNDERSTAND US, AND YOU ARE NO LONGER YOU.”**
