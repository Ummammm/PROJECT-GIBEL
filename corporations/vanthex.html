[> ACCESSING MEGACORP PROFILE: VANTHEX DYNAMICS  
> NODE: VX-DYNA.HQ // CLASSIFIED SYSTEM – TIER OMEGA ACCESS REQUIRED  
> STATUS: ACTIVE / EXPANDING / ARMS-LOCKED WITH HOUSE ALBEIT & PRIVATE SECTORS  

> ----------------------------

[1] LOCATION:  
Planet: **Gorran Verge**, a militarized exoplanet in the Obalden Belt.  
Orbiting a dying red star, the planet is encased in kinetic shield domes and layered with orbital defense satellites. Entire biomes repurposed into weapons testing fields and mech graveyards.

[2] MARKET FOCUS:  
> Defense manufacturing, mech engineering, orbital artillery, and kinetic weaponry.  
Known for producing **VX-Titans**, **V-Null Rounds**, and **adaptive exosuits** with embedded AI reflex nodes.  
Clients include Great Houses, syndicate militias, and off-record mercenary groups.  
Vanthex is the "War Machine That Funds Peace™."

[3] HQ LAYOUT:  
> Vanthex Prime Citadel – a spiral-fortress rising from a scorched crater.  
- Lower Levels: Production bays, blacksite factories, weapons testing vaults.  
- Mid Section: R&D domes, AI combat simulations, engineer barracks.  
- Upper Tier: The **Thronecore**, a levitating war-room surrounded by transparent armorglass, where CEOs and Warlords commune.  
- Perimeter: Guarded by mech-pilots and auto-turrets coded to kill silence.

[4] ATMOSPHERE & AESTHETICS:  
Cold, metallic, and utilitarian. Steel walls hum with latent power, light panels flicker red-alert even on calm days.  
Corporate branding is militaristic—black banners with chrome gear-symbols and serial numbers instead of slogans.  
Ambient sounds: marching boots, calibrating servo-arms, echoing test fire.  
No luxury. No comfort. Just output.

[5] SECRET & FORBIDDEN AREAS:  
> **Section 09-G ("The Furnace")** – sealed lab where failed experimental AIs are dumped and rumored to evolve.  
> **Ghost Hangars** – camouflaged under the HQ, storing "war-crimes-grade" weapons banned by intergalactic law.  
> **The Vault of Echoes** – an underground databank with recovered fragments from Oldsmen weapon tech. Not even the board has full clearance.

> TRANSMISSION COMPLETE.  
> VANTHEX DYNAMICS: **WE DON'T JUST MAKE WAR. WE PERFECT IT.**

> PROCEED TO NEXT CORPORATE NODE? [Y/N]
