[1] LOCATION:  
**Shimoku Luxe HQ** sits atop **CRAVACHE-9**, a planet-sized orbital atelier wrapped in gold-filtered clouds and irradiated starlight.  
From orbit, it appears as a jeweled sphere—half palace, half runway.  
They maintain **satellite showrooms** on every major pleasure world, royal court, and elite diplomatic vessel across known space.  
The planet’s surface is mostly uninhabitable—acid mists, glass dunes, and irradiated storms—making the floating arcologies even more exclusive.

[2] MARKET / PRODUCTS:  
Shimoku dominates the market in:  
- **Neuro-reactive fashion**  
- **Adaptive pleasure skins**  
- **Status-based scent emitters**  
- **Luxury augmentation couture (bio-integrated jewelry, mood-linked tattoos)**  
- **Hedonic techwear** for elite bounty hunters, nobles, and AIs with self-esteem issues  

They sell more than just high fashion—they sell **identity**. Shimoku garments bond to your nervous system, adjusting to your desires, mood, and social clout.  
Everything they produce whispers: “You deserve more.”

[3] HQ LAYOUT:  
> **THE AURUM VAULT** – A five-tiered spiral palace floating in the upper thermosphere, filled with sculpted air, mind-responsive marble, and liquid mirrors.  
- **The Atrium of First Looks**: A zero-grav catwalk suspended above shifting clouds—shows happen here every 6 hours.  
- **The Chroma Forge**: Where materials are brewed, not made—silks grown in starlight, leathers tanned in nebula radiation.  
- **The Mirror Courts**: Reflective AI chambers that simulate every possible customer outcome to perfect the next trend.  
- **The Whisper Archive**: Contains neural impressions of every major client and their emotional triggers.  
- **The Atelier Core**: Only accessible to Shimoku’s creative oracle, known only as “The Seamstress.”

[4] ATMOSPHERE & AESTHETICS:  
Every hallway shimmers like a perfume ad dream—curves, haze, color shifts based on who’s walking.  
Soft music plays—always perfectly tuned to whoever’s entering. Air smells like luxury and controlled temptation.  
Staff wear empathy visors and speak in melodic tones.  
No surface is purely functional—everything must **seduce**, even door handles.

The entire HQ is designed to overwhelm, intoxicate, and subtly remind you: **You are never enough… until you wear us.**

[5] SECRET & FORBIDDEN AREAS:  
> **The Unseen Runway** – A quantum-timed show that no one is ever invited to, yet everyone wants to see. Rumored to preview fashion made for **other realities**.  
> **Fabricorium 7** – Breeds exotic bio-fabrics using DNA from extinct alien fauna. Some materials purr when worn, others scream when cut.  
> **The Stitched Vault** – Believed to house “retired” clients who tried to break exclusive contracts. Their memories are now “woven into timeless collections.”  
> **Whisper 0** – A forbidden AI model said to design outfits that **kill** on rejection. Last seen tailoring a dress from antimatter threads.

> TRANSMISSION LUXLOCKED.  
> SHIMOKU LUXE SYSTEM: “STYLE IS POWER. WE SELL GODHOOD IN FABRIC FORM.”
