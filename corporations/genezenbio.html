> ACCESSING MEGACORP PROFILE: GENEZEN BIOSTRUCTURES INC.  
> NODE: GENEZEN.NEXUS // ASCENSION CLEARANCE GRANTED  
> STATUS: OPERATING / ENLIGHTENMENT IN PROGRESS / SYNCED WITH HOUSE GENEZEN  

> ----------------------------

[1] LOCATION:  
Planet: **Sanctum Viridia**, in the Viridian Bloom System.  
A lush world interwoven with floating biodomes, meditation monoliths, and vast gene-cradle valleys. Entire landmasses are living bio-organisms, grown rather than built.  

[2] MARKET FOCUS:  
> Biomodification, psionic enhancement, regenerative organics, and consciousness-linked medtech.  
Products include:  
- **NeuroSpine Bloomkits™** (instant neural re-growth)  
- **EgoSync Pods** (dream therapy & mind-state cloning)  
- **Living Prosthetics** (limbs that bond emotionally to users)  
- **PlasmaPurge Vials** (curative nanoplasma targeting corrupted DNA)  

Clients range from frontier med-stations to elite Highborn enclaves—plus a few shadow markets with strange payment terms.

[3] HQ LAYOUT:  
> **The Verdant Choir** – not a building, but a living megastructure.  
- Root Level: Sprawling biolabs encased in translucent membranes. Each lab "sings" at a unique frequency for optimal cell growth.  
- Bloom Level: Psionic chamber gardens where executives commune in trance states to align decisions.  
- Canopy Nexus: Floating neural relay towers suspended by anti-grav spores. The Nexus glows with pulses of collective thought.  
- Sacred Core: A temple-core housing the **GENE-CORE** — a bio-AI partially grown from Amanat DNA.

[4] ATMOSPHERE & AESTHETICS:  
Clean, harmonious, and eerily serene. Air is hyper-oxygenated and laced with calming pheromones.  
Architecture flows like plant growth—no hard edges, just elegant curves and photoreactive membranes.  
Staff dress in pale synthsilk robes, eyes often glowing with faint psionic light.  
Background hum of deep breathing, rhythmic heartbeats, and choirlike data tones.  

[5] SECRET & FORBIDDEN AREAS:  
> **Chamber 11-Veil** – hidden biopod facility where “unnatural” Omni modifications are tested.  
> **Samsara Loop** – a restricted lab where failed consciousness transfers are kept in permanent suspended recursion.  
> **The Garden of Reclamation** – an overgrown quarantine zone said to house bio-experiments that developed... sentience.  

> TRANSMISSION COMPLETE.  
> GENEZEN BIOSTRUCTURES INC.: **TO HEAL THE BODY. TO LIBERATE THE MIND. TO ASCEND THE FLESH.**
