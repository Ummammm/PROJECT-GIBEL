> ACCESSING MEGACORP PROFILE: ASTRAL MIRROR NETWORK (AMN)  
> NODE: MIRR-001.PYREFLUX // CLEARANCE: ETHERTIER // STATUS: STREAMING  
> ARCHIVE LOCKED-IN: SIGNAL STABLE / THOUGHTWAVE INTEGRITY: MARGINAL  

> ----------------------------

[1] LOCATION:  
Main HQ floats within **Echo Halo IX**, a massive telepathic ringworld built inside a collapsing nebula called **The Dreaming Scar**.  
Orbiting an abandoned Ascent gate, the entire structure acts as a psychic relay.  
Hidden beneath light distortion fields, Echo Halo IX is barely visible unless you’re already “tuned in.”

[2] MARKET FOCUS:  
> Mass-scale psionic broadcasting, neuro-entertainment, and info-subliminal warfare.  
Specialties include:  
- **SynDreams** (curated neural experiences)  
- **EchoCasts** (galactic propaganda streams & House-branded stories)  
- **ThoughtSync Ads** (inserted into sleep cycles)  
- **Astral Drift Feeds** (realtime soul-data pulled from dying minds)

AMN licenses **brainband frequencies** to Great Houses, warlords, influencers, and even cult leaders.  
Their slogan? _“We stream what you didn’t know you craved.”_

[3] HQ LAYOUT:  
> **Echo Halo IX**  
- Mirror Core: A translucent cube suspended in zero-G. This is where astral anchors and psionic broadcasters pulse in unison.  
- Memory Gardens: Floating biomes populated by living memories, designed for guests to explore past lives or hallucinated futures.  
- Stream Vaults: Psy-lock data servers that whisper in dreams—guarded by Null Priests.  
- Sub-Echo Tier: Where reality begins to glitch and perception breaks. Only high-clearance psions may enter.

[4] ATMOSPHERE & AESTHETICS:  
Every surface reflects you—but not always as you are.  
Glass floors reveal floating thought-threads beneath.  
Halls curve in fractal patterns, shaped by the dominant emotions of the day.  
Color palette shifts based on the global mood algorithm.  
Staff wear **mirror-veils** and speak only in curated phrases—each one trackable back to a paid ad deal.

[5] SECRET & FORBIDDEN AREAS:  
> **The Broadcast Crucible** – an ancient Ascent relic where all dreams are filtered. Whispered to rewrite minds completely.  
> **Vault 0** – stores all unapproved dreams and banned visions, including pre-Gibel prophecies.  
> **The Parallax Loop** – a hallway that traps intruders in recursive realities, turning them into involuntary content.

> TRANSMISSION STABILIZED.  
> ASTRAL MIRROR NETWORK: **"YOU ARE THE SIGNAL."**
