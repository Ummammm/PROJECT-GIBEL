[1] LOCATION:  
**AETHERGATE MINING COLLECTIVE (AMC)** operates across fractured moons, collapsed exoplanets, and sealed sub-dimensions.  
Their primary HQ is the **DEEPGRAVE AXIS**, a subterranean megastructure dug into the hollowed planet **KRAVIS-3**, once a rogue dwarf star.  
They maintain “Core Tunnels” spanning dozens of systems via wormhole boring drills, often mining **invisible or reality-warping ore.**

[2] MARKET / PRODUCTS:  
AMC’s motto: _"If it's buried, we own it."_  
They specialize in:
- **Dimensional resonance ores** (used in time-bending tech)
- **Voidstone** and **Reality Shards**
- **Anti-gravity cores**
- **Quantum lattice alloys** (used in Omni-tier devices)
- Leasing **spacefolding mining tech** to warlords and megacorporations

Most of their materials are considered **too volatile or cursed** to handle without psychotropic shielding.  
They don’t sell stability—they sell **impossible matter**.

[3] HQ LAYOUT:  
> **THE DEEPGRAVE AXIS**  
- **Coreshaft Nexus** – A central tunnel descending 90km into Kravis-3's fractured singularity core. Security turrets hover silently.  
- **Echoforge Caverns** – Where minerals are refined while echo-drone AI record soundwaves from other dimensions.  
- **Gravlock Spires** – Upside-down office chambers suspended by anti-mass fields. The higher your rank, the lower your room.  
- **The Maw** – A living quarry that feeds on spatial anomalies, often collapses in and out of reality mid-cycle.  
- **Neural Dirtline** – A strange hybrid between control center and fungal intelligence grown around the central AI. It thinks in **earth pulses**.

[4] ATMOSPHERE & AESTHETICS:  
Imagine an ant hive designed by Escher on ketamine.  
Everything is dim-lit, bronze-wired, rust-touched. Floor panels hum with seismic rhythm.  
Workers wear gravity braces and void respirators. Some tunnels bend light or produce hallucinations.  
Warning signs are in 4D script. Glowing veins of impossible ore slither through the walls like nervous systems.  
Vibes? “If the planet screams, we’re digging in the right place.”

[5] SECRET & FORBIDDEN AREAS:  
> **Gate Vault 77b** – A sealed tunnel where miners accidentally unearthed what might be a proto-Gate. Now it watches them back.  
> **The Black Hoard** – An inventory cache of classified relics, including fractured Omnicubes and memory-stone weapons. Guarded by forgotten AI.  
> **Rift Bloom Sector** – Overgrown with luminescent spores that grow **only in impossible light**. Entry requires full psycho-armor.  
> **The Deadshift Core** – A chamber containing a chunk of time-locked ore. Everything inside moves in reverse, including thought.  
> Rumor has it... somewhere in the lowest tunnels is **a doorway** made of voices.

> STABILITY THRESHOLD REACHED  
> AETHERGATE MINING COLLECTIVE: “WE DON’T DRILL FOR GOLD. WE DRILL FOR GODS.”
