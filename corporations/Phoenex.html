> ----------------------------

[1] LOCATION:  
**PHOENEX CORP** is headquartered deep beneath the volcanic crust of **SEVERANTH DELTA**, a tectonic hellworld in the Scald Rift.  
The HQ, called **The Ember Spire**, is built inside a stabilized lava column—visible only when eruptions peel the crust open.  
Satellite bases exist across dead planets, asteroid refineries, and artificial suns. Their engineers operate where **no one sane would dare**.

[2] MARKET / PRODUCTS:  
PHOENEX CORP deals in:  
- **Planet-scale energy solutions** (reactor hearts, star plasma extractors)  
- **High-risk terraforming kits**  
- **Volcanic-powered AI cores**  
- **Ashbone armor and heat-dense weaponry**  
- **Blackcore batteries**—unstable but unmatched in power  

They sell raw force—the kind that **melts fleets**, powers war moons, and **gives empires second chances**.  
Their slogan? _“You can rebuild anything if you're the one holding fire.”_

[3] HQ LAYOUT:  
> **THE EMBER SPIRE**  
- **Molten Cathedral**: Main control chamber—floors made of transparent obsidian. Lava flows beneath your feet as decisions are made.  
- **Thermoforge Array**: Multi-chamber reactors where new materials are stress-tested in extreme environments—some tests are fatal to observers.  
- **Ashheart Core**: A cooling chamber housing the mind of PHOENEX’s founder—his consciousness bound to a heat-resistant alloy.  
- **The Furnace Choir**: Cyborg engineers sing to machinery, harmonizing system frequencies for stable ignition (also doubles as morale boost).  
- **Ignition Sanctum**: Where prototypes are born in planetary fire. Entrance requires **Fire-Grade certification** and a body that can survive 400°C for 3 minutes.

[4] ATMOSPHERE & AESTHETICS:  
The whole place looks like it was forged inside a god's forge.  
Industrial gothic—obsidian and chrome walls, pulsing red corelines, oxygen-hardened gears constantly grinding.  
The air smells like copper, smoke, and blood that refuses to boil.  
Employees wear **heat-halo rigs** and flame-resistant tattoos. The dress code? “Functional apocalypse.”  
Music? Mostly silent—except for ambient growls of pressure shifts, tectonic groans, and the occasional distant scream of metal giving way.

[5] SECRET & FORBIDDEN AREAS:  
> **Project PHENIX-00** – A chamber hidden below sea-level magma pressure, said to contain the **first artificial sun** made by human hands.  
> **The Soot Vault** – Stores failed prototypes and “volatile employees.” Doors only open when internal pressure hits lethal levels.  
> **The Ember Reliquary** – Artifacts from planets they’ve burned and rebuilt. Each item radiates guilt or triumph—sometimes both.  
> **The Void Cyst** – An accidental rift to subspace created during a failed test. Sealed in heavy metal and guarded by blind engineers. It **whispers when dormant**.

> TRANSMISSION COOLING...  
> PHOENEX CORP: “WE RISE WHERE OTHERS BURN.”
