> ACCESSING MEGACORP PROFILE: ECLYNE INDUSTRIAL  
> NODE: DRILL-SIGMA.841 // CLEARANCE: HARDHAT+ // STATUS: FUNCTIONAL  
> ARCHIVE STREAM OPENED... PREPARE FOR RUST-CODE SYNC

> ----------------------------

[1] LOCATION:  
ECLYNE’s core HQ is buried within the **Stratovault Belt**, a shattered ring of planetoids orbiting **Crelax-2**, a dead blue giant.  
The belt hosts dozens of tethered megaplatforms, asteroid refineries, and slag-throwing launch lines.  
Main hub: **Forgepoint Prime** – a mobile refinery-core welded to a moon-sized drillhead, constantly burrowing deeper into a ruined world.

[2] MARKET FOCUS:  
ECLYNE specializes in **raw material hyper-extraction**, **weaponized construction rigs**, and **planetary demolition contracting**.  
Their product list includes:  
- **GravMaw Extractors** (planet-core drills that collapse geology into fuel)  
- **BulkTread Units** (terraformer-class mobile facilities)  
- **Seismic Warheads** (used to “excavate” entire cities... officially)  
- **Duststeel™ Composite Alloys** (impervious to voidburn and mech-lash)

They sell to empires, mercs, warlords, and occasionally civilizations on the brink of collapse—ECLYNE thrives on desperation.

[3] HQ LAYOUT:  
> **Forgepoint Prime**  
- Tectonic Foundries: Giant crucibles pouring molten ore into armor plating for orbital drop-mechs.  
- Gravity Recyclers: Waste is vaporized and reconverted into industrial-grade oxygen.  
- Drillheart Core: The beating mechanical center. Temperature fluctuates wildly, but it's said to “sing” when fully active.  
- The Spanner Crypt: A decommissioned part of HQ where old mech-pilots and foremen entomb themselves in rust-sarcophagi.

[4] ATMOSPHERE & AESTHETICS:  
The air stinks of ozone, oil, and rage.  
Everything is bulk steel, exposed pipework, and industrial orange lights flickering against ash-mist.  
Announcements are barked over clunky intercoms.  
Employees wear reinforced exosuits—even the pencil-pushers.  
Every surface has been scorched, rewelded, or bloodied at least once.

[5] SECRET & FORBIDDEN AREAS:  
> **The Ember Shaft** – a seemingly bottomless drillhole rumored to pierce an Ascent vault. Anything sent down comes back... melted, or upgraded.  
> **Zone Black-Slag** – hosts failed weapon projects like living drills and self-mining bombs. Now quarantined by rustbeasts and smelt-ghouls.  
> **The Core Bargain Chamber** – a room locked behind fourteen pressure seals. Only executives may enter. No one knows what’s inside, but it's always warm near the door.

> TRANSMISSION COMPLETE.  
> ECLYNE INDUSTRIAL: “IF IT BREAKS, MELT IT. IF IT SCREAMS, CHAIN IT. IF IT STOPS MOVING, IT’S READY.”

> PROCEED TO NEXT CORPORATE NODE? [Y/N]
