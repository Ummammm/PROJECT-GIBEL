[>] CAPITAL WORLD : Tharuun Forgeheart – A molten-core world powered by supervolcanoes and smog-stained skies, housing massive vertical foundries.

[>] GALACTIC TRAVELS : Their ships are mechanized titans – clunky, overbuilt, but nearly indestructible. Use Engine Rails and magnet-powered launch tubes to slingshot between systems. Many ships feature modular forges that can build new weapons mid-flight.

[>] CIVILIANS : Rugged, clan-based society focused on legacy craftsmanship. Everyone contributes: forge apprentices by age 5, smith masters by 40. Food is hearty: meat stews, fungus bread, ale brewed in machine boilers. Beliefs rooted in The Great Design – the idea that each life is part of a cosmic blueprint.

[>] ECONOMY & TRADE : Exports: Rare alloys, starforged tools, mech frames. Imports: Exotic fuels, luxuries, artistic data (often mocked). Wealth is measured in craftline prestige and forge patents. Trade guilds are powerful, but rivalry often leads to sabotage.

[>] WEAPONS & COMBAT : Brute-force weaponry: rail hammers, chainblades, molten shot cannons. Combat often uses mechanical exosuits called Forge Skins. Special units: Gearknights, Ironshapers, Hammerkin Skalds. Duels settle guild disputes. Winning one can make or break a lineage.

[>] COMMUNICATON & MEDIA : Use ClangNet – a forge-clan comms system using sonic encryption. Media includes invention contests, work-song battles, and mech-wrestling. Legends are passed orally through Rivet Canticles (chant-songs).

[>] LAWS & CRIME : Governed by Forge Law: unwritten but deeply sacred. Crimes include design theft, faulty workmanship, and dishonoring a craft oath. Enforced by Smith Tribunals – roaming judges who carry heat-brand gavels. Punishments range from tool-seizure to clan exile.

[>] RUINS & RELICS : Legendary Forge Thrones are scattered across ancient worlds. Artifacts include lost Ascent Forgecodes, unbreakable metal scrolls, and awakened hammers. Schmied claims to have once reforged a broken Gibel fragment into a living blade – then sealed it away.
