[>] CAPITAL WORLD : Vel'Shara – A glowing techno-city interwoven with crystalline towers and ley conduits. Orbiting an unstable star, protected by advanced Arcanel solar wards.

[>] GALACTIC TRAVELS : Travel through Arc Bridges, sleek ships that weave through sub-dimensional ley tunnels. Can bend time/light in travel, but highly volatile outside Arcanel-mapped paths. Known for Phase Cloaks, Intelligent Ley Engines, and Sentient Ship Cores.

[>] CIVILIANS : Society built around tech-magic mastery; everyone belongs to circles, based on arcane affinity. Food is molecularly crafted, often glowing or floating. Entertainment: holographic operas, arcane dueling arenas, memory-immersion theaters. Religion: The Codex Harmonia – spiritual science guiding all Arcanel life. Language blends code, musical tones, and psi-speech.

[>] ECONOMY & TRADE : Wealth based on patents, data crystals, and arc-engine designs. Export: Magical components, energy cores, time-displacement tech. Import: Rare minerals, slaves (secretly), black-market relics. Social divide between Codex-licensed scholars and outcasts living in ley-rifts.

[>] WEAPONS & COMBAT : Combat mixes ranged spelltech, floating drones, and personal time-rift blades. Favor disruption over destruction: illusions, disarming rays, AI misdirection. Elite Units: Shardborn, Echo Witches, Quantum Reavers.

[>] COMMUNICATON & MEDIA : Instant psi-net across Arcanel territories. News is curated through Memory Echo Pods. Popular: duel streams, time-loop mysteries, philosophical ARGs. Civilian memes? Layered in glitch-art and tech-noir satire.

[>] LAWS & CRIME : Rule by Circle Consensus, enforced by Timecasters and Psi Judges. Crimes include unauthorized tech-splicing, reality folding, and Codex blasphemy. Criminals are mind-imprinted or reality-looped. Underground hosts black data markets, forbidden spell-duels.

[>] RUINS & RELICS : Seek and store Ascent Codices, Reality Keys, and Starseer Cores. Control several floating ruin-cities filled with unstable time energy. They lost control of one Gibel Device; its echo drives a chunk of Vel'Shara mad during solar storms. Lead many expeditions into the Nulith Expanse, though only half return.
