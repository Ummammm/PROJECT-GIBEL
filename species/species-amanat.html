━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[COMMON NAME].................: Ampho
[GALACTIC CODE]...............: SPE-007-AMP/HYD
[ORIGIN WORLD]................: THALMOR IX (deep-ocean colony), now diaspora across various aquatic exoplanets
[STATUS]......................: Independent / Nomadic Clans / Territorial Sea-Sovereigns
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

> APPEARANCE:
Amphibious humanoids with sleek, hydrodynamic frames. Skin varies by subclan—iridescent blues, greens, or pitch-black with bio-luminescent spots. Limbs are long and double-jointed for swimming or ambush. Eyes are fully black, pressure-resistant, and glow faintly in darkness. Gills run along ribcage and neck, with collapsible lungs for surface operations.

> HABITAT:
Thrive in high-pressure oceanic worlds with deep trenches, volcanic reef systems, or underwater cave networks. Above water, they prefer humid or swamp-like environments. Some clans inhabit orbital tanks or carry mobile aquatic habitats on trading barges.

> BIOLOGY:
Dual-adapted respiratory system (gills + lungs). Cold-blooded but regulate internal temperature via neural bio-currents. Skeletal structure is semi-flexible, allowing tight-space movement. Fast reflexes, near-silent locomotion underwater. Regenerative capabilities range from rapid wound sealing to limb regrowth (depending on genetic purity).

> CULTURE & OCCUPATIONS:
- Clans operate under a loose matriarchal caste structure.
- Culturally favor oral storytelling, tattoos, and symbiotic relationships with native sea-fauna.
- Common roles: Depth-scouts, Salvagers, Black-Tide Couriers, Coral Engineers, Assassins.
- Known for smuggling networks and scavenging lost tech from sunken ruins or wrecked stations.
- Trade in rare algae-based stimulants, aquatic weaponry, and encrypted tide-maps.

> RELIGION:
Worship the “Trench-Whisper,” a rumored sentient current believed to guide the worthy through life and death. Each clan interprets the Trench differently—some as a whispering tide god, others as the ghostly pulse of a long-dead ancestor race. Ritual drownings (controlled) are part of adulthood rites to “hear the Current.”

> NOTES [NIEMAND.LOG]
“They came from the mist at low tide. Quiet, smooth, no weapons visible. But I felt them watching me. One spoke in this slow gurgling voice and offered waterfruit... it was sweet, kinda salty. They laughed when I coughed. Then vanished into the fog like ghosts. Polite ghosts. With knives.”
