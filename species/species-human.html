[>] APPEARANCE
Bipedal, soft-skinned beings with a wide range of pigmentation (pale to deep brown), hair types, and eye colors. Average adult height: 1.6–2.0 meters. Body often modified with implants, tattoos, or tech-augments depending on cultural norms and wealth level.

[>] HABITAT
Extremely adaptable. Found on terraformed worlds, orbital habitats, dust moons, and space stations. Can survive in both high-gravity megacities and low-atmo backwaters. Capable of modifying ecosystems to suit their biological needs.

[>] BIOLOGY
Warm-blooded omnivores. High reproductive rate. Average natural lifespan: ~90 years; augmented lifespan: up to 150+. Susceptible to radiation, disease, and extreme environments without protection—but fast to adapt via biotech and cybernetic solutions.

[>] CULTURE & OCCUPATIONS
Highly diverse. From monarchies to anarcho-collectives. Many humans are freelancers, scavengers, warriors, or settlers. House Albeit serves as the most disciplined, war-bred example—while fringe dwellers may lean toward piracy, smuggling, or invention.

‣ COMMON ROLES: Mercenaries, Diplomats, Traders, Researchers, Shipwrights, Drifters.

[>] RELIGION
Fragmented belief systems. Legacy religions from Earth still exist, but new creeds have formed post-collapse. Popular examples include:
  - The Solar Creed (worship of the stars as divine order)
  - The Path of Singularity (techno-transcendence)
  - Regional beliefs (ancestor worship, data-spirits, machine pantheons)

> NOTES:
"Jack-of-all-trades, master of survival. You’ll find a human wherever there’s air, trouble, or profit."
