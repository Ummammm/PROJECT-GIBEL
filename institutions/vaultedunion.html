[3] TYPE OF INSTITUTION:  
**Interstellar Economic & Relic Custodial Trust**

[3] KNOWN FOR:  
The **Vaulted Union** acts as the **universal escrow**, **ancient artifact banker**, and **galactic relic registrar**.  
It’s basically where:
- Lost tech, cursed devices, and priceless cultural artifacts are “secured”  
- Megacorps store their **non-liquid assets**  
- Factions **pawn war trophies**, ancient heirlooms, and even **entire moons**  
- Omnis are **forced** to register any discovered Gibel fragments

Best known for the **99-Lock Vaults**, multidimensional storage cells resistant to time, space, entropy, and gods.

[3] WHO CAN ACCESS IT:  
- **Accredited representatives** from recognized factions or megacorps  
- **Omnis** (if accompanied by a custodian)  
- Rogue entries are **absorbed**, cataloged, and stored—even if they're alive  
- Civilian access? Never. Not even posthumously.

[4] LOCATION:  
> Located on **Vaultpoint Ceres**, an **artificial hollowed moon** surrounded by rotating shield matrices  
- Hidden in the **Dreknal Fold**, a sector where ships glitch out of time without guidance  
- All vault entries are protected by **memory-triggered passphrases** and **reality-tethered sigils**

[5] INSTITUTION’S SECRET:  
- Deep within Vault 0—the **Origin Vault**—it’s rumored the Union holds the **first Gibel Device ever activated**  
- Some say the Vaulted Union isn’t **just** storing relics... it’s **feeding off their energy**, stockpiling for a moment when neutrality no longer profits  
- The Custodians? Not fully human. Not fully machine. Not fully... here.
