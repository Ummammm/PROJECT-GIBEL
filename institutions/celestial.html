====================================================  
>> INSTITUTION: CELESTIAL EXILE COURT  
>> CODE-NAME: “THE LAST JUDGEMENT”  
>> VERSION: 9981-X / Last Updated: [19.09.6274 SY]  
====================================================

[9.1] TYPE OF INSTITUTION:  
Interdimensional Tribunal & Divine Sentence Authority  
A neutral, ancient body formed to judge crimes too vast, complex, or reality-fracturing for any singular faction to oversee.  
Functions like a myth—half law, half religion, half theatre.

It’s not justice. It’s **containment**.

[9.2] KNOWN FOR:  
- Enforcing **Exile Sentences** for entities that cannot be executed, only removed from the known multiverse.  
- Hosting **Existential Trials** for those accused of timeline disruption, Gibel Device misuse, or psychic collapse events.  
- Sealing **World-Breakers**, **Cosmic Traitors**, and **Memory-Eaters** within isolated exile zones like *The Spiral Grave* or *Tesseract Null*.  
- Administering **Erasures**—complete deletion from time-memory-space (only used 11 times in recorded history).

Every sentence passed by the Court becomes **immutable law** across all known Houses and factions. Even the Titanium Tribunal defers.

[9.3] WHO CAN ACCESS IT:  
- Supreme Delegates of major Houses under oath  
- Omni-class beings called as Witnesses  
- Null Priests, Archivists of Genezen, or Shivana Judges as ceremonial Advocates  
- You do not summon the Court.  
  **The Court summons you.**  
- Escape is impossible once summoned; arrival itself is a cosmic binding.

[9.4] LOCATION OF THE INSTITUTION:  
**The Hollow Throne**, suspended in orbit around the fracture-void called **Vesper Null** — a spatial scar where stars refuse to shine.  
The Throne is a fragment of ancient Oldsmen tech interwoven with crystalline justice matrices and paradox-safe chambers.

Key zones include:  
- **The Reflection Hall** — where past sins play on mirror walls, including futures that *could have been*.  
- **The Dread Pillar** — used for psychic restraint of gods, monsters, and cursed AIs.  
- **The Verdict Nexus** — an arena of silence, where only Judges speak, and the sentence echoes across timelines.  
- The court always appears empty, but you’re never alone.  

Judges are faceless, time-frozen beings robed in stars. No one knows if they’re alive… or just animated memories of an extinct race.

[9.5] INSTITUTION'S SECRET:  
The Court **cannot be corrupted**, not because it resists—  
—but because it **no longer exists in linear time**.  
It operates outside of cause and effect.  
Some believe every verdict it has ever given was **pre-decided** eons ago—  
—and that you’re only living out the illusion of choice.

Worse still, some claim that **no one runs the Court anymore.**  
That it is now run by the **Echo of Law Itself**—  
—an emergent consciousness formed from billions of years of cosmic sentencing.

And if the Court ever turns its eyes toward the galaxy itself…  
**No one escapes exile. Not even reality.**
