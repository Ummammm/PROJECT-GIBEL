[7] TYPE OF INSTITUTION:  
Intergalactic Engineering Council / Multispecies Design Tribunal

[7] KNOWN FOR:  
Maintains inter-faction tech compatibility, **regulates high-risk invention**, certifies Voidframe Mechs & Warp Architecture.  
Publishers of the “**Galactic Applied Physics Compendium**” updated every 10 years.

[7] WHO CAN ACCESS IT:  
- Recognized Thinkers, Architects, Schematic Weavers  
- Houses with forged tech lineages (especially Schmied, Arcanel)  
- AI delegates & Titanium Tribunal proxies permitted under truce

[7] LOCATION OF THE INSTITUTION:  
**The Sigil Crucible**, an orbital forge-dome laced with grav-gyroscopes and lava-cycle energy rings.  
Half university, half super-laboratory — the walls whisper in schematics.  
Craftspeople speak of “design visions” occurring mid-dream while inside the Forge.

[7] INSTITUTION’S SECRET:  
Within the gravity-locked Vault lies a **living blueprint** — a semi-sentient document known only as **Project MIMIR**, thought to be co-authored by an extinct race.  
Its contents change based on who reads it… and **what they fear**.
