[6] TYPE OF INSTITUTION:  
**Interstellar Communication Directorate / Surveillance Relay Grid / Meme Governance Bureau**

[6] KNOWN FOR:  
The **Nexus Broadcast Authority (NBA)** manages and regulates **all legal communications** across the known galaxy.  
It governs:
- Holo-news cycles, sub-net chatter, meme-wars, and deepwave music streams  
- Live feeds from warzones, market reports, and even influencer duels  
- Broadcast neutrality during faction conflicts, though heavily criticized for “accidental leaks”

Its most famous slogan:  
**“_If it’s been seen, we’ve streamed it._”**

[6] WHO CAN ACCESS IT:  
- **Media Guilds**, corporate channel owners, and diplomats with clearance  
- Pirates and underground groups often **jack NBA relays** for quick exposure  
- Omnis may receive priority broadcast lanes in war emergencies  
- Civilians? Only what the NBA **lets** them see.

[6] LOCATION OF THE INSTITUTION:  
> Primary HQ: **Wavecradle Spire**, a titanic floating array-station tethered to the magnetic fields of **Vostrum Sun**  
- Covered in dish towers, live-react walls, and anti-telepathic shielding  
- Also houses thousands of "signal monks" who maintain the **Pulse Algorithms**  
- The station’s lower levels broadcast unknown frequencies… even NBA says “_we don’t go down there._”

[6] INSTITUTION’S SECRET:  
- Deep within the Signal Core lies the **First Recording** — a 0.2-second soundbyte of unknown origin  
- Analysis has shown it predates all known civilization and may have **influenced early sentient evolution**  
- Rumors say the NBA’s top engineers built a secret device called the **Echo Siphon**, which can manipulate public emotion by micro-tonal pulses woven into broadcast static
