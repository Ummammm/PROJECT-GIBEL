[OVERVIEW:]  
The Archivum Eternum is not just a library—it is a sovereign construct, older than many civilizations, orbiting a darkened neutron star at the edge of charted space. Constructed partially from stardust composites and ancient alien alloys, it is considered a “Cognisphere Sanctuary.”

Within its infinite fractal chambers reside physical and digital archives of nearly every known galactic culture, extinct species, and divergent timeline.

> -------------------------------------

[1] TYPE OF INSTITUTION:  
**Universal Knowledge Archive / Reality-anchored Library Construct**

[2] KNOWN FOR:  
The **Archivum Eternum** is the **oldest surviving databank** in the galaxy, said to predate even the collapse of the Oldsmen era.  
Known for:
- Housing **every known truth, forbidden secret, myth, and recorded anomaly**
- Maintaining **Echo Crystals**: time-stamped psychic records stored in psionically-stable vaults
- Containing **“The Forgotten Index”**—a catalog of erased civilizations, alternate timelines, and fractured deities  
- Its Librarians are not mortal, but semi-sentient consciousnesses embedded in walking crystalline shells

[3] WHO CAN ACCESS IT:  
- Access granted only to:
  - **Registered Omnis**
  - **Rank-7 Pact Scholars**
  - **Amanat Priests in Rite of Retelling**
  - **Gate Finder operatives with verified Key Imprint**
- Non-authorized entry causes **neural echo implosion**—a form of psychic death where the mind turns into memory fuel for the library

[4] LOCATION:  
> **Located in the core of the “Silent Moon”** orbiting **Vharos-Theta**, a black-hole-adjacent dead system.  
The Silent Moon is uninhabitable and only visible through **quantum-phase triangulation.**  
The facility is buried **beneath the crust** inside a reality-stable “vault chamber,” guarded by immortal data-constructs and paradox loops.

[5] INSTITUTION’S SECRET:  
Rumors speak of a **final locked vault** simply titled **“UNWRITTEN.”**  
This room supposedly:
- Contains knowledge that never existed but still exerts influence  
- Can “overwrite” history, identity, and fate  
- Only opens when someone tries to **forget who they are completely**  
The Archivum is also suspected to be **sentient**, subtly rewriting memories of its visitors to protect deeper truths.  
Some say the Archivum didn’t archive reality—**it authored it.**
