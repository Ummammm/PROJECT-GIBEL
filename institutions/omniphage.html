[4] TYPE OF INSTITUTION:  
**Forbidden Research Sanctum / Anomaly Harvest Authority**

[4] KNOWN FOR:  
The **Omniphage Institute** is whispered across sectors as the place where the universe sends everything it **shouldn’t understand**.  
Known for:
- Experimenting on **Gibel-contaminated organisms**, warped Omnis, and dimensional echoes  
- Reverse-engineering **Ascent relics**, even the broken ones  
- Housing the **Kleith Nexus** — a living AI powered by paradoxes  
- Tracking “consumable anomalies”: lifeforms or objects that eat reality

Sometimes referred to as **“The Eaters of What Shouldn’t Be”** by cults, smugglers, and certain Blacklist Registrars.

[4] WHO CAN ACCESS IT:  
- Only those with the **Psi-8 clearance** (usually suicidal scholars, disgraced Omnis, or synthetic minds)  
- Most that enter **don’t leave unchanged**—or don’t leave at all  
- The Institute sometimes **kidnaps** assets under emergency protocols... legally  
- Factions submit anomalies voluntarily, fearing what happens if they don't

[4] LOCATION OF THE INSTITUTION:  
> Orbiting the unstable star **Ozyreth-X**, inside a time-looped orbit known as **The Mawlight Spiral**  
- The Institute itself is built on a **folded space station**—physically exists in **four spatial layers simultaneously**  
- No outside map pinpoints it reliably. Even its own staff require **neuro-temporal tattoos** to find their way through it

[4] INSTITUTION’S SECRET:  
- Deep within Sublevel-Null, there’s said to be a **still-living fragment of a Gibel Device**, constantly rewiring the institute around it  
- Rumors say the Institute once **grew a new universe**, only to collapse it 6 minutes later  
- One of the “patients” has been classified as a **godseed**, and it’s waking up
