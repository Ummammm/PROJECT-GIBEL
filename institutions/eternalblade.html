[5] TYPE OF INSTITUTION:  
**Warrior-Monk Academy / Relic Weapon Conservatory / Philosophical Kill-School**

[5] KNOWN FOR:  
The **Academy of Eternal Blades** is the most elite and secretive combat institution in the galaxy.  
It trains:
- **Omnis**, assassins, relic wielders, and psionic duelists  
- Keepers of ancient fighting styles, including voiddance, mirrorflow, and silence-draw  
- Users of **Sentient Weapons**, Echosteel, and blades once thought too cursed to exist

They are also known for their brutal rites of passage, including the **Trial of the Mind Split**, where a student must defeat a perfect hallucination of themselves.

[5] WHO CAN ACCESS IT:  
- **Invitation only**, sent via dreaming messengers or anomalous echoes  
- Accepting the invitation means renouncing previous allegiance — even to factions or gods  
- Training takes decades or milliseconds, depending on your path  
- Dropouts don’t exist; you either **ascend or vanish**

[5] LOCATION OF THE INSTITUTION:  
> Located on the shattered moon **Dra’khai IV**, within the ruins of a pre-Ascent citadel  
- Moon is encased in a **time-static veil**, meaning it appears shattered but untouched  
- Academy halls are stitched together from collapsed timelines  
- Map rooms bleed into weapon vaults, meditation gardens float inside vacuum gaps

[5] INSTITUTION’S SECRET:  
- The Academy houses **The Blade Eternal**, a sentient sword rumored to be older than the Ascent  
- Some claim the sword can **choose the fate of stars**, and that it once struck down an entire planetary system  
- At its core is **The Forgotten Wing**, sealed and watched by ten silent monks who have never spoken a word in recorded history
