[2] TYPE OF INSTITUTION:  
**Supra-Governmental Political Entity / Treaty Arbitration Council**

[2] KNOWN FOR:  
The **Pact Council** serves as the **closest thing to a unified galactic law**, enforcing high-level treaties, sanctioning wars, and regulating forbidden tech.  
It is:
- The **arbiter of inter-faction disputes**
- The **legal entity that “permits” megacorporations to exist**
- The body that grants or revokes the **right to form Houses or Factions**
- Famous for the **Unity Accords**, the only document signed by all major Houses and Corporations post-cataclysm

Each seat is held by a **“Voice,”** usually one per major power, with **one mysterious neutral chair left eternally empty.**

[3] WHO CAN ACCESS IT:  
- Only **recognized Faction Leaders**, **Omni Diplomats**, or **Certified Galactic Justiciars**
- All discussions and sessions are **translated in real-time through mind-linked consensus nodes**
- Civilians can **observe transmissions** under heavy delay (approx. 9 days post-broadcast)

[4] LOCATION:  
> Stationed aboard the **Judicara Bastion**, a ringworld constructed around the fractured remnants of a neutron star.  
- The Bastion is held in place by a **gravity lock system** built from Arcanel and Titanium Tribunal tech  
- Contains multiple “Wings” for each major group, with a central **Neutral Chamber** surrounded by psionic silence fields

[5] INSTITUTION’S SECRET:  
- Deep within the Judicara Bastion is the **“Room of Second War”**, a hidden courtroom where **unrecorded verdicts** are passed on entities considered too dangerous for history  
- Some say **several species, entire planets, and at least one Great House** have been “Second War’d”—erased from public memory by official decree  
- The Neutral Chair? Rumored to belong to the **Ascent Core** itself—or whatever’s left of it
