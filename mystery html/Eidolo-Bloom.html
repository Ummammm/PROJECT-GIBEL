EVENT OVERVIEW:

The first signs appeared on the edge of Orphia’s Lash, a dense asteroid cluster known for its mineral wealth. Within weeks, inert rocks began sprouting bizarre crystalline flora—translucent structures that pulsed softly, like they were breathing.

Miners called them *The Bloom*.

At first, the phenomenon was ignored—assumed to be some form of mineral reaction. But then the accidents started. Machinery failed. Crews vanished. When one drone returned with footage, the truth unraveled: people weren’t just dying—they were becoming part of the Bloom.

Crystals had grown into their bodies. Not violently. **Elegantly.**

Victims stood upright, serenely posed, as the formations bloomed from their mouths, eyes, and fingertips. In the footage, they hummed—together—in perfect, unnatural harmony.

> LOCATION:

Designated Zone: **Orphia’s Lash Asteroid Belt**  
Outer Rim — Theta-22 Mining Region  
[Formerly operated by Eclyne Industrial; now red-zoned by Pact Council decree]

---

> CURRENT STATUS:

**Quarantined. Containment Unstable.**  
Several attempts to study or destroy the Bloom have failed. Energy weapons seem to be *absorbed*. Samples brought back to labs began spreading crystalline roots through steel and bone.

One bio-arcanist stated:
> "It’s not flora. It’s not tech. It’s an idea—growing."

All contact with a Stellakon blacksite research ship ceased two months ago. Weeks later, fragments of the ship drifted back to a trade lane, polished clean, covered in singing crystals.

> KNOWN RUMORS:

> "The Bloom remembers you. It knows your regrets. It shows you what you want—and then keeps you."  
– Whispered among smugglers avoiding Orphia’s routes.

> "I saw my daughter. She’s been gone a decade. The Bloom let her talk to me."  
– Survivor testimony (unverified).

> "They’re learning. Mimicking us through our corpses. Rehearsing."  
– Recovered audio from AMN probe before it was lost.

> "Don’t stare at the crystals too long. They start... blooming in your thoughts."  
– Mental Health Advisory, Forgefront Concord
