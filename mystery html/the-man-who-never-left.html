:: ARCHIVAL ENTRY — [THE MAN WHO NEVER LEFT] ::  
█████████████████████████████████████

[DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:]  
They say on the fractured station of **Virell Station Delta**, there’s a maintenance corridor deep in the lower decks that **never stops pinging a life sign**. The tag is always the same: **ID#8927-K – Jonas Merev**, listed as “**cleaning crew**.”  

Problem is… Jonas died **eighty-three years ago**. Logged. Buried. Cremated. All of it.  
Yet every cycle, at exactly 03:33 Virell time, a blurred figure can be seen walking the corridor, mop in hand, pausing by **a wall that isn’t on any blueprint**.  

He never responds. He never turns.  
Security teams sent to investigate?  
Every single one comes back with no memory of going in.  
One came back with a *different birthday*.

[LOCATION:]  
Site: **Virell Station Delta**  
Orbiting: **Broken Moon Halress**, outer rim  
Current Owner: Formerly ECLYNE INDUSTRIAL, now decommissioned and considered haunted by five different cultures

[CURRENT STATUS:]  
🔒 **Quarantined Sector**  
Station logs auto-purge all recordings after 03:34.  
Rosettax AI flagged the lifeform as both organic and "multi-temporal."  
The Pact Council has issued a “Soft Redaction Protocol,” preventing commercial salvage crews from accessing the lower levels.

Some whisper that Jonas isn’t a ghost… but **a temporal echo**, or something far worse that **took his name**.

[WHAT PEOPLE SAY:]  
> "He always mops. Always. Even if the floor’s gone." – Ex-security officer  
> "We left that station for a reason. But it didn’t leave us." – Eclyne Maintenance AI Fragment  
> "There’s an airlock that only opens when he's near. Don’t look through it. Just… don’t." – Survivor log, wiped from database
