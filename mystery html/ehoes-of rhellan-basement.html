[DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:]  
Rhellan was once a thriving world—until its capital city, **Vaen-Sur**, experienced a **total auditory blackout**. No speech. No footfalls. No sound of any kind.  

It started in the **underground chambers** of the city’s **first parliament building**, now referred to as *“The Basement.”* Engineers investigating a strange **subharmonic hum** went missing, and the ones who came back? They could only **communicate through humming**—no words, just haunting harmonic tones.

The tone got into their heads. Into the walls. Then into the city.  
Now, the entire district is considered acoustically cursed.  
No devices work within. **Recordings return only static.**  
People who step inside report hearing "versions of themselves whispering secrets they never told anyone."

[LOCATION:]  
Planet: **RHELLAN**  
Region: Sub-surface government district of **Vaen-Sur Prime**  
Status: Locked down by local militia; officially listed as a "failed excavation"

[CURRENT STATUS:]  
🔇 **Permanent Audio Lockdown**  
Access strictly forbidden by House Genezen due to psychic contamination risks.  
They built an echo-dampening dome over the area, but the hum leaks through—**especially during eclipses**.

Researchers from the **Omniphage Institute** believe the Basement connects to an **undiscovered pocket reality**, possibly a Gibel-adjacent phenomenon.  
Locals just call it "The Mouth Below."

> "The hum told me what I did. What I would do. And what I should never do." – Confessor transcript, redacted  
> "Rhellan ain’t haunted. It’s *listening.* That’s worse." – Old scavenger from Thermalae
