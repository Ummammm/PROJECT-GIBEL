:: ARCHIVAL ENTRY — [KARELL VOX] ::  
████████████████████████████████████████████████████  

[DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:]  
Karell Vox is not just a planet. It’s a **thinking, remembering, listening** world.  

Initially charted as a lifeless rock orbiting the dead sun *Enris*, Karell Vox was ignored by early explorers due to its absolute silence—no atmosphere, no magnetic field, no seismic activity.  
But the silence wasn’t natural.  
It was **deliberate**.  

Around Cycle 7003, a Nex Vox Gateway team crash-landed here during a misaligned jump. Only **one** of the eight survived. When he was recovered a week later, he was mute, eyes burnt black.  
He carved one sentence into the hull of his escape pod before dying:  
> “It spoke in *my* voice.”

Since then, unmanned probes returned scrambled audio logs—some playing **direct transcriptions** of the user's own memories… even if that user never visited Karell Vox.

Exploration logs note:
- The *planet mimics voices* of explorers hours before they speak.  
- Surface structures **rearrange subtly** when no one is watching.  
- Memories fade on approach, only to be played back by ambient sounds—wind, dust, static.  
- A growing number of dead comms satellites orbit the planet, all broadcasting a soft whisper in **every known language**, repeating only one word:  
> “Remember.”

[LOCATION:]  
Karell Vox  
Sector: G-199, Outer Veil Expanse  
Orbiting the dead star Enris, near Null Drift Corridor  

[CURRENT STATUS:]  
🛑 **REDACTED – SOVEREIGN INTELLIGENCE ZONE**  
Locked down by the Pact Council and the Blacklist Registry.  
All Gate FTL routes to Karell Vox are fragmented or “ghosted.”  
Ships that attempt arrival often report sudden course correction, fuel loss, or navigational blackouts before disappearing entirely.

Several rogue archaeologists believe Karell Vox may be an **ancient AI construct**, or a dormant **Oldsmen consciousness** trapped in planetary form.  
Others fear it is a **void-born entity** that consumes memory as sustenance.

[WHAT PEOPLE SAY:]  
> “The stars forget you as soon as you leave its orbit.” – Unknown scribbled on a recovered drone  
> “Karell Vox doesn’t *speak*. It makes you *say what it wants*.” – Former Blacklist officer, now missing  
> “It showed me the day I died. I haven’t lived it yet.” – Journal from a Gate Finder dropout  
> “Every time I sleep, I see its surface. But I’ve never been there.” – Survivor of the Ikarra-7 orbit loss
