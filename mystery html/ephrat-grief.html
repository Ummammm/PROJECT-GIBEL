:: ARCHIVAL ENTRY — [EPHRAT’S GRIEF] ::

[DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:]

Ephrat was not a place—but a person. A bio-engineer and empathic cartographer from the early **Voyage Era**, Ephrat Lenn devoted her life to mapping emotional topographies across alien ecosystems. Her theory? **Planets remember pain.**  

She built a facility on a quiet, fog-draped world called **Tellis-V**, designed to sync her brainwaves with the planetary subconscious. The experiment worked—too well. In her final log, she whispered:  
> “I found the grief beneath the crust. It weeps in colors I cannot name.”

Three days later, the facility’s emergency beacon activated. A rescue team arrived to find **no bodies**, but the structure had been reshaped into a vast helix of twisted alloy and bone—Ephrat’s own skeletal structure **etched across the walls**, grown like veins.

Stranger still, **the atmosphere now induces mourning**. Visitors experience vivid hallucinations of loss—of loved ones who never existed, memories that aren't theirs. Some report spending hours sobbing uncontrollably. Others come out calm... eerily so.

Worse: her resonance map—a lattice of planetary emotions—remains active. It now pulses like a living heart, and **broadcasts psychic distress** across deepwave frequencies.

[LOCATION:]  
Tellis-V, Veil Sector, just beyond Ampho territory.  
Note: Cartographer’s Ascendancy has declared the system **"Emotionally Quarantined."**

[CURRENT STATUS:]  
🟡 RESTRICTED + HAUNTED  
– Facility overgrown with emotional echo flora  
– Map lattice still functioning  
– Anyone remaining more than 2 hours enters a **state of melancholic stasis**  
– At least 12 researchers have gone missing; 5 returned but speak only in riddles

[WHAT PEOPLE SAY:]

> “She didn’t die. She dispersed.”  
– Excerpt from unauthorized Gatefinder scan log

> “My son walked into that lab with a broken heart. He came out with a *borrowed* one.”  
– Recorded testimony, now redacted

> “I met her. Not Ephrat—her grief. It touched me. It knew my name.”  
– Final words of Monk-Diver Kael Juno

> “Tellis-V isn’t haunted. It’s mourning. And it wants you to understand why.”  
– Marginalia scribbled into a Cartographer’s Fieldbook, found near the helix
