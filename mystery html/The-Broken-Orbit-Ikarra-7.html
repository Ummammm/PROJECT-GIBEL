> EVENT OVERVIEW:

Ikarra-7 was once a thriving terraform-class colony moon orbiting the gas giant **Nemethe**, located in the **Yrris Prime Belt**. It had a reputation as a peaceful, self-sustaining haven—rich in water, lush forests, and magneto-thermal energy farms.  

That was before **the orbit broke**.

At 04:37 GMT Standard, orbital sensors around Yrris Prime registered a sudden, violent spatial distortion—a **fracture** in gravity alignment so severe it cracked Ikarra-7’s orbital path. The moon didn’t crash or shatter. Instead, it began **spiraling in irregular ellipses**, violently oscillating between two impossible positions.

Time desyncs occurred. Colonists experienced days in seconds, or months in minutes. Structures bent unnaturally. Animals mutated mid-step. Some were seen aging into skeletons while still walking.

Worse, the **sky bled backward**—sunlight reversed, moonlight looped in erratic frames.  

The colony went dark.

> LOCATION:

**Yrris Prime Belt**  
Ikarra-7’s current orbital drift puts it in and out of standard hyperspace routes unpredictably.  
Fleet paths have been rerouted around the “Gravity Laceration Zone.”

Unconfirmed reports claim fragments of Ikarra-7 now phase in and out of warpspace across multiple sectors.

---

> CURRENT STATUS:

**Abandoned. Uninhabitable.**  
Multiple failed rescue missions. Drones sent in return corrupted or with **inverted internal geometry**—rooms inside-out, staircases looping into black space.

House Schmied's engineering guild declared the orbital fracture “**a violation of Newtonian integrity**.” They don't believe it's natural. House Arcanel theorists claim the moon is being "pulled" between **two timelines.**

Gate Finder teams consider the area a potential **Gibel Device echo** or fragment leak. No confirmation.

> KNOWN RUMORS:

> “Time bled weird there. My brother called me on comms. Said he was being born. He’s 34.”  
– Former orbit engineer **Sanna Trell**

> “The trees grew teeth. Some grew faces. Some grew mine.”  
– Voice recording from crashed survey drone X3-IBIS

> “It’s not just orbiting wrong—it’s orbiting **something else**. Something we can’t see.”  
– Notes left on a drifting shuttle near Ikarra-7, signed only “N.”

> “We don’t know if the colony’s dead. We only know they’re **no longer in our time.**”  
– Pact Council statement
