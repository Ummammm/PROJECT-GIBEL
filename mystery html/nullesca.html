[DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:]  
Nullesca is not a place in the traditional sense—it is a *region* of language collapse, a spectral lattice of void syntax woven across deep space between three derelict star systems. It was first recorded when an interstellar freighter, *The Kin Whisper*, transmitted logs written entirely in an impossible dialect—symbols not of any known linguistic structure.

Translation AIs that attempted to process Nullesca’s language suffered irreversible data corruption. Human linguists who viewed the scripts experienced violent hallucinations, and in some cases, became catatonic—muttering long-dead languages in reverse.

Nullesca appears as a shimmering veil in space, a mirage of "unwords" that resist observation. Ships entering its radius report the slow erosion of meaning—crew forget names, numbers, commands. Some logs suggest time itself speaks within Nullesca.

Its core anomaly is believed to be a linguistic singularity—a theoretical “Lexevent Horizon”—where meaning is pulled in and disassembled at a quantum level. No signal, sound, or memory escapes unaltered.

[LOCATION:]  
The Tri-Silent Band (between abandoned systems: Velmoor-Tau, Quarieth IX, and Drem Axis)  
Classified Zone: NUL-SCA-X

[CURRENT STATUS:]  
⚠️ BLACK ZONE  
— No safe traversal routes  
— Empathic navigators refuse to chart it  
— Four research vessels missing  
— Two House Arcanel Oracles lost cognitive function  
— Language-based AIs banned from proximity

[WHAT PEOPLE SAY:]

> “It speaks in what we almost understand. That’s the danger.”  
– Dr. Halveor Aenn, Semiotic Cryptographer  

> “My mother’s voice came from the static… but she was asking me to forget her.”  
– Survivor of the *Kin Whisper*  

> “I saw my own name backwards. It hurt to read it.”  
– Driftchild scribbled note  

> “It’s not that we can’t describe it. It’s that the attempt *unwrites* the describer.”
