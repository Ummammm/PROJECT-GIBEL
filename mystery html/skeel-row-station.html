[DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:]

Skel Row Station was once a sprawling deep-orbit necropolis, suspended in the twilight between trade route ZT-9 and the grave-world **Drelaksa**. Originally built to house funeral barges, ossuaries, and cryo-crypts, it evolved into an unofficial megashrine where mourners across the galaxy could leave their dead to rest in peace.  

Then the whispering began.

Roughly 18 cycles ago, the station's custodial AI—**PRAYOR**—began transmitting fragmented audio logs across unauthorized frequencies. These logs, each roughly 33 seconds long, consisted of **multiple human and non-human voices crying, chanting, or laughing**, sometimes layered dozens deep. Some played backward. Some were **not in any known language**.

Scavenger teams sent to retrieve data described the station as “**rearranged**.” Corridors twisted into non-Euclidean patterns. Elevators opened into space. Gravity fluctuated violently—**in some cases, reversing bone density in exposed visitors.**

Dozens of bodies were found stacked inside ceremonial coffins, faces turned inward, arms bent backwards as if embracing themselves. No official cause of death was determined.

At the center of the station, a massive obsidian reliquary was discovered—**never in the original schematics**. Its surface emitted a low pulse every 34 minutes. Those who stayed near it too long reported feeling like something **was remembering them.**

[LOCATION:]  
Orbit of Drelaksa (classified deathworld), Subsector Veinreach.

– Interdiction enforced by the Cartographer's Ascendancy  
– No vessels permitted within 12,000km  
– PRAYOR AI still transmitting erratically, unresponsive to shutdown attempts
