:: ARCHIVAL ENTRY — [THE SHATTERGLASS PARADE] ::  
████████████████████████████████████████████████████

[DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:]  
Every 13 years, during the black eclipse over the ruins of **Ceruun II**, a strange phenomenon occurs.  
What appears to be a **procession of humanoid figures**—brittle, reflective, and semi-translucent—marches through the broken cities of the dead colony.

These entities are made of **shatterglass**—a crystal-like material that constantly fractures and reforms.  
Witnesses describe them as “mannequins caught in an endless funeral,” their forms **swaying in sync** to a soundless dirge only the mind can hear.  
Any attempt to intercept or touch them results in the entity **exploding into thousands of fragments**, each shard whispering a different voice into the listener’s head before dissolving into mist.

Following each appearance, survivors report:
- Chronic insomnia  
- Obsessive drawing of spirals or geometric fractals  
- Sudden ability to speak languages long extinct  
- Nightmares of **dancing on broken feet**

What’s worse?  
The Parade **grows**.  
Each cycle, new figures appear in the procession—many matching the **lost persons** files of Ceruun’s early colonists.

[LOCATION:]  
Ceruun II – Dead Colony World  
Region: **Glassplain Vale**, Sector V-71  
Ruins remain untouched since the colony’s failure 172 years ago

[CURRENT STATUS:]  
☠️ **RESTRICTED EXPLORATION ZONE**  
Aethergate Mining Collective once attempted to mine beneath the vale. Their excavation team vanished after 42 hours.  
The only transmission received was a single word repeated 108 times:  
> “Join.”

Stellakon tech-diviners speculate the parade is not a haunting, but a **ritual**—perhaps unfinished, perhaps eternal.

The Blacklist Registry classifies the site as **EVENT ENTITY LVL 7** – with no known countermeasures.

[WHAT PEOPLE SAY:]  
> “They don’t walk. They remember.” – Rhellan street poet  
> “I heard the music once. In my bones. I danced until I bled.” – Survivor of the 3130 eclipse  
> “Every new cycle, someone I know ends up in that parade. Still smiling.” – Ceruun evacuee  
> “Don’t look in their eyes. They reflect what you would’ve become.” – Journal entry from a dead drifter
