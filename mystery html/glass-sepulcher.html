:: ARCHIVAL ENTRY — [THE GLASS SEPULCHER] ::  
████████████████████████████████████████████████████

[DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:]  
Deep within the shattered crust of **Planet Sel-Narah IV**, half-buried in irradiated salt plains and scorched obsidian ridges, lies a vast crystalline structure known only as *The Glass Sepulcher*.

The building is not made from any known mineral. Its jagged towers, translucent walls, and floating chambers seem to shimmer with internal reflections—like light trying to escape a memory.

It is silent inside. No life. No temperature. No dust. Time, seemingly, refuses to flow within its walls.

But the deeper one ventures, the louder the reflections get.

Explorers report seeing warped versions of themselves roaming ahead in the glass, making choices they haven’t yet made—conversations that haven’t happened, regrets they never voiced. The Sepulcher *shows futures*, or at least… *possibilities*.

Some return from it changed—disoriented, eyes glowing faintly, obsessed with decisions they claim they “already made.” Others vanish entirely, their last comms filled with the sound of breaking glass and repeated phrases like:

**“I saw what I became.”**  
**“There were too many of me.”**  
**“She remembered me wrong.”**

According to whispers, at the Sepulcher's core is a suspended figure—shimmering, perfectly still. Not alive. Not dead. Locked mid-scream. Theories range from an ancient Omni to a trapped god, or even the *first soul* ever broken by the Gibel Devices.
