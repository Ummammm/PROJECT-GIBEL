[DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:]  
At first, Brinn’s Fall was assumed to be a meteorological anomaly—until experts realized the planet wasn’t falling… space itself was.

The colony of Brinn was built on the serene, forested world of Greshaar-Tau, a planet known for its low gravity and thriving moss-crystal ecosystems. Floating cities, gravity gardens, and silent prayer domes dotted its skies. Art and architecture floated in delicate suspension.

On Cycle 7211.143, Brinn’s moon vanished without impact or trace. The next 72 hours unraveled reality.

Gravity began to shift—not downward, but toward a fixed point in the sky. Floating cities twisted. Trees bent sideways. Objects fell upward. One witness described it as a “hole in the stars that swallowed light in reverse.”

Entire structures, and eventually the entire planetary crust, folded into this gravitational wound. Communications reversed mid-sentence. A final distress beacon played backwards in an eerie melody before silence.

Brinn didn’t fall—it was unwritten.
