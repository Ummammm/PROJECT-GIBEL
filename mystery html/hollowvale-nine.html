[DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:]

Hollowvale Nine was originally designated as a Class-IV terraforming colony, commissioned by the House of Genezen during the Pax Expansion phase. For over forty years, it served as a model settlement—lush domed farmlands, engineered atmosphere, and a thriving multi-species community of 20,000. Then, contact ceased.

Upon investigation, a rescue team found the colony intact—no signs of struggle, no bodies, no signs of evacuation. Every building was untouched. Meals half-eaten. Water still running. Lights still powered. But **every inhabitant had vanished.**  
There were no footprints leading out. No escape pods launched. No distress calls received. Only the colony’s AI, “**LENORA**,” remained online, endlessly broadcasting the same phrase in a child's voice:  
> “We’re all in the garden now. The sun is coming.”

Deep scans of the area revealed bizarre inconsistencies:
– **No sound** could be recorded beyond a 1-kilometer radius of the colony center.  
– **Shadow movement** detected in open areas, with no light source present.  
– **Time dilation effects** occurred randomly, with certain devices reporting a 5-second delay in the perception of reality.

The colony’s garden dome was found overgrown with **impossible flora**—bioluminescent vines that didn’t register on any known genetic database, and flowers that emit a low harmonic hum that induces sleep in most species. No one who slept near them has ever woken.

[LOCATION:]  
Sector 44-G, Abyssal Verge system — moon of Tralvex Prime.  
Officially expunged from navigational databases post-incident.

[CURRENT STATUS:]  
🛑 QUARANTINED BY MULTIPLE FACTIONS  
– Genezen no longer acknowledges the site  
– Entry punishable by fractal isolation sentence  
– A few unauthorized scavenger crews claim to have “seen the garden bloom”

[WHAT PEOPLE SAY:]

> “It’s not abandoned. It’s just… tilted.”  
– Spacer rumor, common among Gate-runners

> “My brother was born there. He left when he was five. Keeps drawing sunflowers with mouths.”  
– Civilian from Cradle Market, whispers during interview

> “The colony’s still there. I saw it last month. But the sky was different.”  
– Testimony from rogue AI scout drone, decommissioned due to errors

> “You can go in. Just don’t listen when the flowers ask your name.”  
– Carved into the hull of an abandoned drop ship, docked at Orris Drift
