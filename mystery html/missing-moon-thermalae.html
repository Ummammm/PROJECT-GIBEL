:: ARCHIVAL ENTRY — [THE MISSING MOON OF THERMALAE] ::  
████████████████████████████████████████████████████

[DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:]  
Thermalae, the glacial gas giant of the Irid Belt, once had **three moons**.  
Now it has **two.**

The third moon, **Virellia**, was not destroyed.  
It was **erased**.

One solar cycle, it orbited normally—an icy sphere with subsurface ocean labs used by Eclyne Industrial. The next? Star charts updated without notice. Tidal data adjusted. All automated systems showed only two moons.  
Even the **people who lived there** were scrubbed from records, but their names and faces **still appear in the dreams** of those who worked near Thermalae.

Astral Mirror Network was the first to raise the alarm when a repeating psychic broadcast—just the phrase **“we’re still here”**—began emanating from the orbital shadow of where Virellia *should be*.

It’s a null-space now.  
No light enters. No signal escapes.  
Yet sometimes ships passing too close receive sudden, corrupted audio logs in unfamiliar voices—**claiming to be survivors** of a moon no one recalls.

[LOCATION:]  
Planet: **Thermalae**, Sector I-03  
Former Moon: **Virellia** (status: Nullified)  
Current Coordinate Marker: BLACK ZONE ECHO-21

[CURRENT STATUS:]  
🛰️ **CELESTIAL GHOST ANOMALY**  
Classified under the Cartographer’s Ascendancy as an "Echo Scar"—a region where **space-time refuses to behave normally.**

Attempted scans result in **temporal feedback noise**.  
Ships that drift into the zone experience:
- Sudden memory loss  
- Fabricated logs from future selves  
- Missing time stretches (up to 47 hours unaccounted)  
- Visuals of a ghostly silver sphere **phasing in and out** of existence

Astral Mirror Network has issued a **NO-WARP perimeter**, and even Titanium Tribunal vessels avoid it.

[WHAT PEOPLE SAY:]  
> “The moon isn’t gone. It’s hiding.” – Whispered phrase overheard in the Cryodawn Bazaar  
> “I have three moons in my birth chart. My file says two.” – Astrologic refugee, unaware of any anomalies  
> “There’s a face in the gas storms now. It’s watching the orbit.” – Drifter log, timestamp corrupted  
> “I lost my brother on that moon. Now I only remember him when I’m near it.” – Unverified testimony, Nexus Broadcast Archive
