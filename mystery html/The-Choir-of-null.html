> EVENT OVERVIEW:

The first reports came from deep-space salvage crews near **Sector N-0X**, a cold, unnavigable region unofficially known as the **"Dead Laplace"**—a gravitational deadzone thought to be devoid of life, matter, or signal.

But then… a *song* was heard.

Not broadcast. Not transmitted. **Heard.** Simultaneously. Across different ships, species, even AI.

Each described it differently—a lullaby, a requiem, a plea—but always in perfect harmony. The melody had no detectable source. Audio logs never captured it. Yet those who heard it… remembered every note.

And then they changed.

Some wandered into airlocks mid-chorus. Others began humming the melody obsessively, their speech turning into choral verses. Neural scans showed cortical erosion replaced by harmonic resonance patterns—brains *rewriting themselves as instruments*.

> LOCATION:

**Unmarked Sector N-0X ("Dead Laplace")**  
Border of mapped voidspace between Galdrin Reach and the Outer Silence  
Recent expansion of the anomaly suggests spread into adjacent warp routes.

NOTE: All coordinates associated with the Choir are now redacted from public starmaps.

---

> CURRENT STATUS:

**Containment: Impossible. Spread classified as “Cognitive-Acoustic Contagion.”**

Attempts to jam, mute, or firewall the anomaly fail; in fact, suppression seems to intensify the melody’s psychological grip. AI exposed to the Choir become inert—frozen mid-process as if "listening."

The Pact Council currently denies the Choir’s existence, though multiple House Arcanel and Titanium Tribunal probes have gone dark near the region.

Genezen monks claim the melody matches ancient "Universal Lamentation" scriptures predating the Collapse.

> KNOWN RUMORS:

> "I heard it. It knew my name. And then... it sang the names of everyone I’ve ever lost."  
– Last transmission from long-haul pilot **Brinna Voss**, now missing.

> "The Choir doesn’t want to hurt you. It wants you to join the harmony. It wants you to stop screaming."  
– Scribbled on a bulkhead wall of abandoned ship *Steller’s Grief.*

> "It’s not a song you hear. It’s a song you **become.**"  
– Titanium Tribunal AI [Designation: ORAX-3.1] before voluntary shutdown.

> "They say there's no such thing as silence anymore. Just softer parts of the Choir."  
– Drifter saying.
