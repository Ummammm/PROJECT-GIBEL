:: ARCHIVAL ENTRY — [STELLAR WOUND THETA] ::
█████████████████████████████████████

[DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:]
At the edge of the Naos Drift lies a spatial anomaly known only as *Stellar Wound Theta*—a fixed rift carved through a white dwarf star. Unlike natural phenomena, this wound doesn’t collapse, pulse, or emit expected radiation signatures. It appears as a **motionless gash of pure black** across the sun’s surface, unaffected by gravity, time, or energy output.

Spectral scans reveal impossible geometry around the wound, suggesting **spatial bleed** into other dimensions or realities. Drones sent inside return distorted footage or, more often, not at all. One probe transmitted a single phrase in dead languages from three different worlds:  
_"It was not a star—it was a lock."_

[LOCATION:]
Designated Zone: **Theta-Orbit S4**  
System: **Naos Drift Outskirts**  
Coordinates: [REDACTED]  
Classified by: **Vaulted Union + Rosettax AI Syndicate**

[CURRENT STATUS:]
⚠️ **Highly Restricted**  
All travel lanes rerouted within a 2 AU radius.  
Rosettax Black Processors maintain a 24/7 observation grid.  
A Gibel Signature Pulse was recorded during a recent microflare—but discredited by Vaulted Union officials.

Rumors of **time loop fractures**, sudden memory erasures, and crew hallucinations persist from vessels that stray too close.

[WHAT PEOPLE SAY:]
> "My cousin’s ship drifted near the edge of that sector once. Came back with all his teeth... **reversed** in his skull." – Unknown trader, Voxhole  
> "Whatever’s inside that star isn’t burning. It’s **watching**." – Former Arcanel Sensor Mage  
> "The Choir of Null started singing louder when Theta flared. Coincidence? No such thing." – Gatefinder report [classified]
