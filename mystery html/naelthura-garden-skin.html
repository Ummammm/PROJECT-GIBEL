:: ARCHIVAL ENTRY — [THE NAEL’THURA SKIN GARDEN] ::  
████████████████████████████████████████████████████

[DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:]  
Deep beneath the bioluminescent canopies of **Nael’Thura**, past the acidic saltwinds and floating stone roots, lies an anomaly unlike anything else in the known galaxy—**The Skin Garden**.

It doesn’t have a local name anymore. The tribes that used to live near it have all disappeared. Some say they were “harvested.” Others say they were **assimilated**.

What grows there? *Not* trees. *Not* fungus.  
They’re referred to as “**Eiderm Bloom-Stalks**,” smooth, humanoid-height flora with visible vascular systems and soft, wrinkled outer membranes that **mimic the skin tones, blemishes, scars, and tattoos** of real people.  
Some even have **faces.**

The Garden was first discovered by a terraforming team from House Arcanel. They reported a mass of “organic mirrors” that **spoke back** in their own voices… but altered. Older. Broken.  
The final transmission before signal loss simply read:  
> “It grew me again.”

[LOCATION:]  
Planet: **Nael’Thura**  
Coordinates: ███-███-FRACTURE-SPORE 37  
Proximity: 9km from the ruins of the lost Arcanel research dome "AZ-BLEED"

[CURRENT STATUS:]  
🧬 **CLASS 8 BIOANOMALY ZONE**  
Marked as a GIBEL-LEVEL contamination field  
Surrounding air contains **memory-borne viral spores**; exposure time beyond 4 minutes results in cognitive echo fragmentation (CEFracture).

Omniphage Institute has quarantined the zone with pulsefield pylons, but strange growths have been seen forming **outside** the perimeter—blooms of flesh that **whisper names of people not yet born**.

A cult calling themselves “**The Gardened**” reportedly worship the site, believing the flora are **the true archivists of soulprint continuity.**  
Their leaders claim that every person who dies is “re-seeded” there.

[WHAT PEOPLE SAY:]  
> “I saw my mother’s back tattoo on a vine. She died a decade ago. It was *fresh*.” – Genezen biocleric, currently in stasis  
> “The Skin Garden remembers you. Then it becomes you. Then it forgets you existed.” – Field report, Arcanel Black Archive  
> “They say it grows a new bloom for every lie you tell inside it.” – Local Nael'thuran myth  
> “They bloomed me. I can hear myself screaming even when I sleep.” – Unknown survivor, neural signature corrupted
