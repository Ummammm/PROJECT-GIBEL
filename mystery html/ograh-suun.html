:: ARCHIVAL ENTRY — [THE SPIRAL TEMPLE OF OGRAH-SUUN] ::  
███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

[DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:]

At the heart of **Yssenthar Coil’s** deepest trench—beneath layers of fractured tectonic plates and gas-locked magma veins—rests a megastructure known as the *Spiral Temple of Ograh-Suun*.

No known race built it.

The temple coils endlessly downward like a nautilus shell carved from voidglass, its walls covered in ancient, breathing glyphs that **change when unobserved**. Scholars say the structure predates even the Ascent, possibly constructed by a civilization erased from memory—*or from time itself*.

Those who descend the spiral path report vivid hallucinations: flashes of unknown wars, celestial titans screaming in a language that shatters eardrums, and visions of being rewritten—cell by cell, identity by identity.

The deeper the descent, the **less one remembers of who they were**.

Some never return. Others emerge with blank stares, repeating the name “Ograh-Suun” like a prayer or curse—before violently attacking those around them, screaming:  
> “*It must remain spiraled. The pattern must not be broken.*”

The temple’s center is said to contain an **anti-heart**, a metaphysical anomaly that pulses **backward through time**, slowly undoing everything it touches. The Gatefinder Guild once attempted to extract it. They sent in five squads. *None returned.*  

Since then, the site has been sealed under a pressure field maintained by House Arcanel and monitored jointly by the Pact Council and The Vaulted Union.
