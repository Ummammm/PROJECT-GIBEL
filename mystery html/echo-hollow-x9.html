:: ARCHIVAL ENTRY — [ECHO-HOLLOW X9] ::  
████████████████████████████████████████████████████

[DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:]  
Echo-Hollow X9 was an asteroid station deep within the static shell of the *Noctri Veil*, originally established by Stellakon as a clandestine research and listening post. Its primary function was to intercept “non-native” frequency disturbances—patterns not tied to any known civilization, beacon, or AI source.

Roughly 17 cycles into operation, the station began recording what analysts described as “pre-emptive distress calls”—signals that included screams, cries for help, and ship logs… for vessels that had not yet launched.

The recordings grew more intense. Entire distress transmissions from *nonexistent* ships—some in dialects that didn’t yet exist, some referencing systems still uncharted—flooded the archive.

The last known log from the X9 crew came in the form of a full-blast override signal. It repeated one phrase for 67 hours across five languages:

**“We heard ourselves die, and we answered.”**

When a retrieval team arrived, the station was empty. No bodies. No power signatures. Just equipment still running, silently replaying hundreds of recordings that fade out the moment anyone listens fully.

[LOCATION:]  
Outer belt of the Noctri Veil  
Sector Theta-K-11, Deep Uncharted Zone  
(Sector maps list the zone as [REDACTED])

[CURRENT STATUS:]  
🚫 CLASSIFIED: BLACK QUIET ZONE  
— Entry only granted to Stellakon’s High Council  
— No known successful re-entry missions  
— Repeating loop signal still active from local relay  
— Frequency unable to be jammed or silenced  

[WHAT PEOPLE SAY:]

> “I listened to one log. Heard my *own* death. In perfect clarity. Only I’ve never been on a ship before.”  
– CivNet post, swiftly scrubbed  

> “Echo-Hollow doesn’t trap people—it just shows you who *was always going to disappear*.”  
– Former Stellakon Signal Tech  

> “They weren’t intercepting enemy signals. They were *hearing the end of time trying to warn itself*.”  
– Prof. Elun Var  

> “Never name your station after an echo.”  
– Anonymous Graffiti, found carved into a derelict probe launched from X9
