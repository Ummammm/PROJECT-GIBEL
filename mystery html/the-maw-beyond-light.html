> DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:

In the edges of the Jotuun Expanse, sensors picked up a spatial fold that shouldn’t exist—a void that consumes **light** itself. Ships passing near reported full blackout even in close solar proximity. One scout vessel broadcast a distress call where the crew repeatedly screamed “We’re being unmade” before the signal cut out.  

The phenomenon is now dubbed *The Maw Beyond Light* — a rift or entity that devours photons, sound, and most terrifyingly… thought itself. All automated drones sent to investigate return blank slates, their memory cores wiped clean.

---

> LOCATION:

Unmapped zone between Gorran Rift and the collapsed dwarf system *Eileth-V*. Exact coordinates are inconsistent, as jump drives tend to “slip” during approach.

---

> CURRENT STATUS:

**Uncontained. Growing.**  
Astrophysicists from House Arcanel and AMN speculate it's either a sentient singularity or a broken fragment of pre-reality. Several fringe cults have started calling it "The Mouth of the First Silence."

Surveillance rings placed around the area go dark within 48 hours.

> WHISPERS & THEORIES:

> “If you stare into it long enough, it starts pulling *you* out of yourself. People near it get real quiet. Like, soul-level quiet.”  
— Void-miner refugee, now institutionalized.

> “It’s not that it eats light. It’s that it *remembers* what light was.”  
— Anonymous transmission, likely AI-corrupted.

> “There's a rhythm. Like a song. It vibrates in your bones. You want to join it... even as it forgets what you are.”  
— Final log of a Golden Theatre smuggler, later found orbiting the void in fetal position.
