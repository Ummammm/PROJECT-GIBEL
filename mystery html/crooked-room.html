[DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:]

Vault E-7 was a mid-tier research facility operated jointly by the **Vaulted Union** and rogue elements of the **Titanium Tribunal** during the Reconstruction Era. Its original purpose was unknown until a scavenger broadcast surfaced, showing footage from within a room described as “*wrong at every axis.*”

Inside the so-called **Crooked Room**, physical laws are inconsistent—angles twist in impossible directions, gravity fluctuates with emotion, and **cause sometimes follows effect**. Time loops fracture into brief moments of déjà vu and déjà future. No single individual experiences the room the same way.

The room appears to shift itself—walls reform when unobserved, and the door cannot be found from the inside. It’s not always in the same location within Vault E-7, either. Entire corridors are reported to change their layout overnight, like the vault is trying to hide the room from itself.

Worse, those who stay inside for too long develop a syndrome nicknamed **"The Wobble"**—a neurological condition where the body begins to sync with non-Euclidean space. Victims speak in recursive loops, hallucinate overlapping realities, and eventually vanish entirely... with only a faint hum left behind.

The origin of the Crooked Room remains unsolved. Some whisper that it was grown rather than built—an **offshoot of Nullspace** seeded into realspace, blooming like a tumor. Others claim it’s the tomb of an idea that was never meant to be thought.
