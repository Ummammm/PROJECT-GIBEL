>> [ NEUTRAL HUB LOG ENTRY #03 ] :: NEX VOX GATE
--------------------------------------------------------

[1] TYPE OF HUB:  
↳ **Ancient Galactic Relay + Message Exchange Nexus**  
Nex Vox Gate is an ancient alien structure turned communications hub. Orbiting a dead binary star system, it's the size of a small moon and built from obsidian alloy and starsteel, laced with whispering tech filaments older than any known race.

It was discovered accidentally, and no one fully understands how it works—but it connects comms, minds, and even dimensional echoes.

[2] KNOWN FOR:  
↳ **“The Station That Hears the Galaxy.”**  
It’s the final relay point for deep void messages, psychic transmissions, coded gate pings, and pan-faction broadcasts too sensitive to trace. Governments, rebels, bounty hunters, AI tribes—all use it to listen in or send encrypted pulses.

Some say it also receives messages from the **dead timelines**—fractured universes that no longer exist.

[3] FACTIONS SEEN:  
↳ You’ll find everyone with something to say—or something to hide:  
- **Arcanel Tech-Clerics** praying at signal-altars  
- **Wayferrer Guild** intercepting lost transmission paths  
- **Golden Theatre fixers** scrubbing audio trails  
- **Titanium Tribunal relay siphons** living in the station’s walls  
- **The Blacklist Registry** taps its deeper echo-channels for dead contracts  
- **Gate Finder operatives** check for Gibel Device pulse data from collapsed sectors

[4] SPECIAL FEATURE:  
↳ **Echo Chamber Sigma-7**: A soundless void room where messages are “heard” through pure neurological resonance. Only Omnis or high-sensitivity psychics can interpret it—and sometimes even they bleed from the nose trying.

↳ **The Vox Well**: A long-forgotten pit in the station’s core that emits distorted signals from unknown sources. Some say it’s a direct link to whatever built the Gates… or whatever destroyed the Ascent.

[5] VIBE / CONDITIONS:  
↳ Cold, haunting, and filled with whispers.  
The lights flicker with no clear pattern. Halls stretch forever or loop back in impossible ways. Audio distortion is constant: echoes of forgotten transmissions, ghost laughter, alien war chants, or your own voice out of sync.

No one stays long. Time feels… **off** here.

Security is handled by sentient drones called **Null-Tongues**—they don’t speak, just gesture, and they only attack when someone tries to breach the sealed lower levels.
