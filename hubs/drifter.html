--------------------------------------------------------
>> [ NEUTRAL HUB LOG ENTRY #07 ] :: DRIFTER’S RUN  
--------------------------------------------------------

[1] TYPE OF HUB:  
↳ **Deep-void Waystation / FTL Graveyard / Memory Refuge**  
Drifter’s Run floats just beyond the edge of most galactic maps—a derelict space hub caught in a quantum current that occasionally shifts its location. It's the final stop for wayfarers heading into unexplored voids or for those looking to vanish.

[2] KNOWN FOR:  
↳ **"The Place You End Up. Or Disappear Into."**  
A crossroads for:
- Retired smugglers
- Fugitives with fake names
- Travelers with nowhere else to go
- Burned-out Omnis needing silence
- Those seeking the mythical “Last Gate”

Drifter’s Run isn’t on any official star chart anymore. Those who find it either meant to… or were called.

[3] FACTIONS SEEN:  
↳ It varies—but always fringe. Often:
- **Wayferrer outcasts** documenting strange signals
- **Genezen rogue scientists** running end-stage experiments
- **Golden Theatre agents** filming goodbye reels
- **Arcanel mystics** mapping soul-echoes
- **Titanium Tribunal fragments** scanning for lost AI relics

Also home to:
- Vagabonds
- Memory-sick AI
- War deserters
- Star-cult prophets

[4] SPECIAL FEATURE:  
↳ **The Run Gate** – A broken and partially-reactivated Oldsmen Gate embedded in the station’s core. It hums, pulses... sometimes whispers. No one knows where it leads. A few brave (or mad) souls step through. None return.

↳ **The Drift Wall** – A massive panel of names, etched with plasma cutters and tears. It's a tradition for every traveler to leave their name—or someone they’ve lost.

↳ **The Black Echo Lounge** – A zero-gravity bar inside a defunct cargo bay where patrons float, drink, and record their final thoughts. All feeds go into a locked core memory bank called *The Vault of Final Wills*.

[5] VIBE / CONDITIONS:  
↳ Quiet. Haunted. Dreamlike.  
The station creaks and hums like it’s remembering something. Time feels slower. Conversations are whispered. People here don’t look for new beginnings—they come for closure, or to fade away.

There’s warmth in the silence. Ghosts in the halls. Stars out the windows that no one's ever mapped.

**Drifter’s Run is where stories end—or start again under different names.**
