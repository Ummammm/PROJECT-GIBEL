>> [ NEUTRAL HUB LOG ENTRY #06 ] :: THE SCORCHED STEPPE  
--------------------------------------------------------

[1] TYPE OF HUB:  
↳ **Unregulated Trade Wasteland & Duel Grounds**  
The Scorched Steppe is a neutral zone only by technicality. It’s a superheated expanse of cracked obsidian deserts, magma rivers, and thunder-ash skies—used by mercs, smugglers, and exiled Houses to settle disputes, dump contraband, or test new weapons where no laws can stop them.

[2] KNOWN FOR:  
↳ **"Trade. Trial. Treachery."**  
The Steppe is infamous for three things:  
- Blood contracts and final duels  
- Illegal weapons testing  
- Smuggler’s bargaining pits  
If you need something banned in 12 sectors, or want someone erased without political blowback, this is where you come.

[3] FACTIONS SEEN:  
↳ Anyone brave, desperate, or mad enough:  
- **House Albeit** duelists ending bloodlines in honor duels  
- **Golden Theatre** agents filming executions as “performance art”  
- **Phonecian** rebels bartering plague-tech for ammo  
- **Band of Thrope** using it as a live training ground  
- **Drifters**, **Ex-Omnis**, and **Wayferrer exiles** seeking silence or death

[4] SPECIAL FEATURE:  
↳ **The Ember Crucible** – A natural arena of volcanic glass, where heat distorts time. Dueling here is legally binding and ends only in surrender or death. Every major faction has left blood in its sands.

↳ **The Molten Bazaar** – A hidden lava-cooled marketplace under a slag-covered cliff. Vendors sell blacklisted cybernetics, synthetic souls, cursed voidtech, and worse. Barter only. Credits melt.

↳ **The Obsidian Graves** – A wasteland of vitrified remains, where glass statues of past duelists still stand—frozen mid-battle, their flesh burned and flash-fused. Some whisper they still dream.

[5] VIBE / CONDITIONS:  
↳ Hell turned sideways.  
Ash rains from a choking orange sky. The ground cracks underfoot, pulsing with heat. Visibility is low, tempers are high, and betrayal is expected.  

There’s no law here. No alliances. No gods. Only deals, blood, and fire.

If Lazareth Hollow is where the broken heal…  
**The Scorched Steppe is where the desperate burn.**
