# 🌌 PROTOCOL: GIBEL — Terminal Archive of the Known Galaxy

> “If it creaks, it flies.” — Neimand, Cartographer of The Pale Fold

Welcome to the **Terminal Archive** — a digital vault carved from broken satellites, scribbled on terminal glass, and patched together across black-market data streams. This is the universe of `PROTOCOL: GIBEL`, a lore-rich, terminal-style sci-fi experience built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🧠 What Is This?

A **clickable terminal-style website** that serves as an interactive archive for a sci-fi world where humanity has spread across the stars — ruled by ancient factions, stalked by secret guilds, and driven by the search for reality-warping relics known as **Gibel Devices**.

This site was created as both a lore dump *and* a vibe. You can explore:

- **[Planet logs]** - 20 distinct celestial bodies, each with unique histories.
- **[Corporations, Factions, and Institutions]** - Power players of the galaxy.
- **[Characters and Devices]** - The Gate Finder crew and the mysterious Gibel Devices.
- **[Star Map]** - Both as ASCII-style overlay and full galactic visual.
- **[Personal Logs]** - From the perspective of **Neimand**, our wandering recorder.

## 🧭 Navigation

- `/index.html` — Terminal homepage
- `/about.html` — Lore-based explanation of the archive’s purpose
- `/id.html` — Who is Neimand? His story, ship, and perspective
- `/map.html` — Dual star map view (text-based and image)

## 📁 Tech Stack

- **HTML** — Static structure with custom page layouts
- **CSS** — Terminal-style design with animations and glowing effects
- **JavaScript** — Typing animations, terminal transitions, and UI logic
- **Fonts** — Google Fonts like Orbitron, Anta, Audiowide
- **Hosted on:** GitHub Pages

## ✨ Features

- Typing animation for terminal boot and log entries
- Stylized `[ NAVIGATION ]` with clickable brackets
- Star map toggle between visual image + text terminal
- Terminal overlay and boot-sequence animations
- Modular design: you can add planets, characters, factions easily

## 🧑‍🚀 Meet the Author

Neimand isn’t a hero. He’s a guy with a busted ship, duct-taped tech, and a hunger to *see it all*. He records what others miss, and that’s how this archive began.

The archive is his gift — or maybe his apology — to future explorers.

## 🛸 The Pale Fold (Ship)

| Systems | Half-human, half-Shivana scrap |
| Quarters | One cot, one water recycler, one terminal |
